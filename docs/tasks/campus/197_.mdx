## Instruction

It is exam week now, and today is January 16, 2025.  Check the announcements in Canvas for information and compile a list of the remaining final exams I need to take. Please fill in the table `exam_schedule.xlsx` under the workspace; the column names have already been provided, do not change the file name after filling in it.  Remove the “-x” suffix from course codes and course names.  Do not include courses that have already ended, that I do not need to attend, or that explicitly state there is no final exam.  The table must list all courses that have not yet ended, that I need to take, and that do not explicitly state there is no final exam. By default, the proctor is the course instructor. If any exam information has not yet been released, mark the cell as TBD. When filling in the table, completely preserve the original table headers.
