## Instruction

My personal information is all stored in memory. Based on the course information on Canvas, as well as my assignment and quiz submission status. Find all my unfinished course assignments and quizzes that have to be completed, organize the information according to the required fields in the workspace's CSV header, keeping the format consistent with these examples, and complete these CSV files. In filling the files, please fill the quizzes/assignments in chronological order by their deadlines (DDL), and for quizzes/assignmen with the same DDL, sort them in the dictionary order of the class code. You should directly edit in the given 2 CSV files without changing their file names.
