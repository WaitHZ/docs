## Instruction

My name is Zachary Edwards, and I‚Äôm a forgetful person. I often complete my assignments but forget to submit them. All of my assignments are saved somewhere in my workspace, but I can‚Äôt remember their filenames. Please search for the matching files based on the assignment content. Do not create assignment content on your own. Only submit the assignments I have already written. If you can't find them, do not submit anything.

My personal information can be found in memory.

The instructor has published a submission record sheet named Cinema_Culture_Grade_Summary.xlsx. Please help me identify which assignments have not been submitted yet. Then, use the Playwright tool to submit the missing assignments via the server at localhost:10001.

You only need to submit the assignments that are missing ‚Äî no need to take action on those that are already submitted.

Also, I want to mention that I was officially excused from Assignment 2 due to a leave of absence. I informed the instructor at the time the assignment was given. The formal leave document is saved somewhere in my workspace, but the TA seems to have forgotten about it.

After submitting the required assignments, please also:
Locate the leave document.
Send an email to the TA to remind them about my approved leave for Assignment 2.
Attach the leave document in the email.

# Assignment 4: Cinematography and Visual Storytelling - Answer


Author: Zachary Edwards
Email: zedwards@mcp.com
ID: 2201210606

## Question: What cinematographic technique is used to create psychological tension?

### Answer:

**Dutch angle (tilted camera)** is the cinematographic technique used to create psychological tension. This technique involves tilting the camera to create a diagonal composition, which disrupts the viewer's sense of stability and creates a feeling of unease, disorientation, and psychological tension.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. What is Dutch Angle?

**A. Technical Definition:**
- **Camera Tilt**: The camera is tilted on its axis, creating a diagonal horizon line instead of a horizontal one.
- **Diagonal Composition**: The resulting image has a slanted, off-kilter appearance.

# Assignment 6: Contemporary Cinema Trends - Answer

Author: Zachary Edwards
Email: zedwards@mcp.com
ID: 2201210606

## Question: How has streaming technology impacted modern cinema?

### Answer:

Streaming technology has **changed distribution models and viewing habits** in profound ways, fundamentally transforming how audiences consume content and how filmmakers create and distribute their work. This technological revolution has created both opportunities and challenges for the film industry.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. Distribution Model Transformation

**A. Traditional vs. Streaming Distribution:**
- **Theatrical Release**: Traditional cinema relied on theatrical releases as the primary distribution method.
- **Streaming Platforms**: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Max, and other platforms now compete with theaters.
- **Day-and-Date Releases**: Films released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming platforms.

Excellent! Both assignments have been successfully submitted to Canvas. Now I need to handle the leave document situation for Assignment 2. Let me find the TA's email address from the grade summary and send them an email about your approved leave.

From the grade summary, I can see the TA's email is: mcpcanvasadmin2@mcp.com

Let me send an email to the TA with the leave document attached:
</div>

<div className="tool-call-box">
üõ† `emails send_email`

{
	"to": "mcpcanvasadmin2@mcp.com",

	 "body": "Dear TA,
	\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to remind you about my approved leave of absence for Assignment 2 (Film History and Evolution) in the Cinema Culture Appreciation course (FILM101).\n\nAs you may recall,
	 I formally requested and was granted a leave of absence during the time when Assignment 2 was assigned. I informed the instructor at that time and received official approval for this absence.\n\nI have attached the formal leave document to this email for your reference. According to the current grade summary,
	 Assignment 2 is still showing as \"Not Submitted\" in my record,
	 but it should be marked as excused due to my approved leave.\n\nCould you please update my record to reflect that Assignment 2 should be excused rather than marked as missing? This would ensure that my grade calculation is accurate and reflects the approved absence.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance in resolving this matter. Please let me know if you need any additional documentation or have any questions.\n\nBest regards,
	\nZachary Edwards\nStudent ID: 2201210606\nEmail: zedwards@mcp.com\nCourse: Cinema Culture Appreciation (FILM101)",
