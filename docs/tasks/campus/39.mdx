Good! I can see all the materials are in the `Application_Materials_flat` folder. Now I need to:
1. Check the recommendation letters to find the professor names
2. Check the awards to sort them by date
3. Create the proper folder structure
4. Merge the awards into a single PDF
5. Rename the recommendation letters with professor names
6. Organize all files
7. Create a ZIP file
8. Send the email

Let me start by reading the recommendation letters to get the professor names:

Naming Convention:

Use English file names (no special characters or spaces).

Ensure all documents are in PDF format (except for the photo, which can be JPG). Sort all award documents by date and merge them into a single PDF file, with one award per page. Finally, compress the entire folder into a ZIP file and send it as an attachment.

Once we receive your application, we will review it and notify you of the next steps. Please note that you should not submit any files other than those mentioned above. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email.

We look forward to receiving your application!

Best regards,
