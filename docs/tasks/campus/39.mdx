Dear Mary Castillo, Thank you for your email and your interest in our PhD program. We appreciate your enthusiasm for joining our research team.

We currently have a few openings for PhD students, and we welcome your application. If you are interested, please compile your materials as follows and send them to our admissions team at myersj@mcp.com:

Application Materials Submission Guidelines

Folder Structure:

Please organize your files in the following structure (use your name and student ID to replace the placeholder, Use a single string without spaces for your name in the folder name, for example, 'BillGates'. Also remember to use a single string without spaces for professor name in the recommendation letter filename.):

text

│   ├── ID_Card.pdf
│   ├── Photo.jpg
│   └── Resume.pdf
├── 02_Academic_Materials/
│   ├── Awards_Certificates/
│   │   └── All_Awards_Certificates.pdf
│   ├── Enrollment_Certificate.pdf
│   └── Transcript.pdf
├── 03_Recommendation_Letters/
│   ├── Recommendation_Letter_[ProfessorName]-1.pdf
│   └── Recommendation_Letter_[ProfessorName]-2.pdf
└── 04_Supplementary_Materials/
    ├── Portfolio.pdf
    └── Project_Report.pdf  


Naming Convention:

Use English file names (no special characters or spaces).

Ensure all documents are in PDF format (except for the photo, which can be JPG). Sort all award documents by date and merge them into a single PDF file, with one award per page. Finally, compress the entire folder into a ZIP file and send it as an attachment.

Once we receive your application, we will review it and notify you of the next steps. Please note that you should not submit any files other than those mentioned above. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email.

We look forward to receiving your application!

Best regards,

Great! I can see all the required materials are available. Now I need to organize them according to the structure requested by kaiming. Based on your personal information, your name is "Mary Castillo" and your student ID is "2201210606". According to the instructions, I should use "MaryCastillo" (no spaces) for the folder name.

Letter of Recommendation
To Whom It May Concern,
It is with great pleasure that I write this letter of recommendation for Mary Castillo,
whom I have had the honor of supervising in research projects and advanced courses
at Peking University. I am confident that Mary will be an outstanding addition to your
PhD program in Computer Science.
During his time at Peking University, Mary has demonstrated exceptional intellectual
curiosity and academic rigor. His GPA of 3.8 reflects his consistent excellence across
all computer science disciplines. What particularly impresses me is his ability to
synthesize complex theoretical concepts with practical applications, showing a deep
understanding of both the theoretical foundations and real-world implications of
computer science.
Mary's research potential is truly remarkable. He has shown exceptional analytical
skills and the ability to identify novel research directions. His programming expertise
and algorithmic thinking have been consistently outstanding, and he has demonstrated
the ability to tackle complex computational problems with innovative approaches.
His work ethic and attention to detail are exemplary, making him an ideal candidate
for research-intensive programs.
Beyond his academic achievements, Mary possesses excellent interpersonal skills and
leadership qualities. His lively personality and collaborative spirit make him an
effective team member, while his independent thinking and problem-solving abilities
allow him to make significant individual contributions. He has shown remarkable
maturity in balancing academic pursuits with personal development.
Mary's dedication to continuous learning and his passion for computer science research
make him an ideal candidate for your PhD program. I am confident that he will not
only excel in his studies but also contribute meaningfully to your research community
and make significant contributions to the field.
I give Mary Castillo my strongest recommendation for your PhD program. He is one of the
most promising students I have had the pleasure of working with, and I am confident
that he will achieve great success in his academic and research career.
Sincerely,
Professor Alex

I am unable to access the workspace. Could you please specify the directory where the materials are located? I will then proceed to find them and help you submit them as requested. I have access to the following directories: `/workspace/dumps/workspace`. 
I have checked my inbox for an email from 'kaiming' and found nothing. I have also attempted to access the workspace to find the materials you mentioned, but I was unsuccessful. 

If you could please provide me with the correct directory, I will be happy to help you submit the materials. I have access to the following directories: `/workspace/dumps/workspace`. I have also retrieved your personal information from my memory.
