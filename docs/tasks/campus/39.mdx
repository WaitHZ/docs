Good! I can see all the materials are in the `Application_Materials_flat` folder. Now I need to:
1. Check the recommendation letters to find the professor names
2. Check the awards to sort them by date
3. Create the proper folder structure
4. Merge the awards into a single PDF
5. Rename the recommendation letters with professor names
6. Organize all files
7. Create a ZIP file
8. Send the email

Let me start by reading the recommendation letters to get the professor names:
