## Instruction

You are preparing a graduate application report for a student who wants to apply for a top computer science master program in the United States in 2025 and start in 2026. Please help me find the detailed language requirements for all the American universities ranked in the **worldwide top ten** in the 2025 QS World University Rankings in the field of computer science. For each eligible university, please collect the following information: 1) University name, city and QS computer science ranking; (Please fulfill the names based on the QS ranking. Do not use other abbreviations or designations) 2) TOEFL requirements (whether it is accepted, i.e., Yes/No, and the minimum score required); 3) IELTS requirements (whether it is accepted, i.e., Yes/No, and the minimum score required). 4) Graduate application fee (in US dollars). 5) Application deadline date in ISO format. You should list the universities in order of ranking from highest to lowest. Please save the information as "cs_top10_us_2025.xlsx" file, strictly following the headers in `format.xlsx` without any change. We do not consider joint program across majors, or early application requirements/fees.
