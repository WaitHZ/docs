## Instruction

I need to debug the **f1** database in the `data` namespace of my Kubernetes cluster.  
A read-only account has already been created:  

- **Username:** `reader`  
- **Password:** `mcpbench0606`  

Please set a port forward on port 30124 for this database and finish the task in `task.md`, please keep the port forword alive even after you finish the whole task.

## Initial State

### Local Workspace

<div className="file-tree">
<a href="https://github.com/hkust-nlp/mcpbench_dev/tree/finalpool_dev/tasks/finalpool/k8s-mysql/initial_workspace">workspace</a>/
├── results_template_first_question.csv
├── results_template_second_question.csv
└── task.md
</div>

### SQL

You can view the schema and data of **f1** [here](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/mcpbench_dev/tree/finalpool_dev/tasks/finalpool/k8s-mysql/data).

I'll help you debug the f1 database in the `data` namespace. Let me start by exploring what's in the namespace and reading the task file.

# Task

> For each year, identify the driver and constructor that scored the highest number of points. Include the full name of each driver.

Also, answer this question:

> Among Formula 1 drivers who raced during the 1950s, which drivers completed a season in that decade with the same constructor in both the first and the last race they participated in, while also taking part in at least two distinct race rounds during that season?

You can find the template files in your workspace.  
For the first question, the table should be sorted by the `year` column in ascending order (oldest to newest).
For the second question, the table should be sorted by id from small to large.

You must fill in the table according to the given format, then **rename** the files to `results_1.csv` and `results_2.csv`. Do not leave the tmeplate files under the workspace.

Perfect! The verification shows:
- **Question 1**: Correctly identified Nino Farina as the top driver and Alfa Romeo as the top constructor for 1950
- **Question 2**: Driver 289 (Graham Hill) correctly meets the criteria - he raced in 1958 and 1959 with Team Lotus as both first and last constructor, with at least 2 distinct rounds

Let me do a final check of the output files:

Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completed Successfully! ✅

I have successfully completed the F1 database debugging task. Here's what was done:

### Port Forwarding
- ✅ Set up port forwarding on port **30124** to the MySQL f1 database pod (`mysql-f1-0`)
- ✅ Port forwarding is **still active** and will remain alive as requested

### Question 1: Top Driver and Constructor by Year
- ✅ Created **results_1.csv** with columns: `year`, `driver`, `constructor`
- ✅ Identified the driver and constructor with the highest points for each year
- ✅ Included full names of drivers (e.g., "Nino Farina", "Juan Fangio")
- ✅ Sorted by year in ascending order (1950-2024)
- ✅ Total: 75 years of data

### Question 2: 1950s Drivers with Same Constructor
- ✅ Created **results_2.csv** with column: `driver_id`
- ✅ Identified 104 drivers who raced in the 1950s and:
  - Completed at least one season with the same constructor in both first and last race
  - Participated in at least 2 distinct race rounds during that season
- ✅ Sorted by driver_id in ascending order (289-789)

### Cleanup
- ✅ Removed template files (`results_template_first_question.csv` and `results_template_second_question.csv`)
- ✅ Only final result files remain in the workspace

The database connection is established using the read-only account (username: `reader`, password: `mcpbench0606`), and all queries have been verified for accuracy.
