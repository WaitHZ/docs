## Instruction

Please find all developers' branches in the `BenchTasksCollv3` project for the most recent commits that added new tasks. For each person’s new tasks, check the development status (do not check the file content). If the implementation satisfies the requirements, it is considered implemented; otherwise, it is considered implementing. Update our Notion page: `Task Tracker` based on the new tasks, and create a new branch in GitHub named finalpool, adding all of the implemented tasks in Notion Page to finalpool, with the relative path in the project being `tasks/finalpool`.

Tips:

- You could find the requirements in `tasks/examples`
- In addition to the content requirements explicitly mentioned in the examples, only the existence of the file needs to be checked
