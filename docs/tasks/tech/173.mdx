Perfect! I've successfully collected information about the milestone GitHub repositories and saved it to `github_info.json`. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Successfully Collected:

1. **Repo ID 1** - The very first GitHub repository!
   - Name: `grit` by mojombo
   - Created: October 29, 2007
   - A Ruby library for Git access (now deprecated)
   - 1,997 stars, 512 forks

2. **Repo ID 1,000,000** - The one millionth repository
   - Name: `nexus.vim` by vim-scripts
   - Created: October 18, 2010
   - A Vim syntax highlighting plugin
   - 2 stars, 2 forks

3. **Repo ID 1,000,000,000** - The billionth repository!
   - Name: `shit` by Red-Killer
   - Created: June 11, 2025
   - 3,998 stars, 278 forks
   - Interestingly, this repo has gained significant attention as the billionth repository milestone!

## Not Found:
- **Repo ID 1000** - This repository returned a 404 error, meaning it either doesn't exist, was deleted, or is inaccessible. As requested, I've skipped it in the output file.

The data has been saved to `github_info.json` in the requested format with all the specified fields.
