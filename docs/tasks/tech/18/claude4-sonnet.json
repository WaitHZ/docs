Introduction\\\\nAnnoy-DataSync is a novel approach that transforms code-based reasoning patterns into natural language formats to enhance Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities. Unlike traditional methods focusing on specific skills, our approach systematically extracts universal reasoning primitives while maintaining procedural rigor, enabling better performance across various reasoning tasks.\\\\n\\\\n**Key Features \\\\u0026 Contributions**\\\\n- \ud83d\udd04 Universal Transformation: Converts diverse code patterns into natural language Chain-of-Thought rationales\\\\n- \ud83e\udde0 Syntax-Decoupled: Decouples reasoning from code syntax while preserving logical structure\\\\n- \ud83d\udcca Multi-Task Enhancement: Improves performance across symbolic, scientific, logic, mathematical, commonsense and code reasoning\\\\n- \u2728 Fully-Verifiable: Supports precise prediction verification through cached ground-truth matching or code re-execution\\\\n- \ud83d\ude80 Advanced Iteration: Enhanced version (Annoy++) with multi-turn revision for better accuracy\\\\n\\\\n## Released Resources\\\\n\\\\n#### Dataset\\\\n\\\\n|Dataset|Link|\\\\n|-|-|\\\\n|Annoy-PythonEdu-Rs|[\ud83e\udd17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-Pyedu-Rs)|\\\\n|Annoy-PythonEdu-Rs-Raw|[\ud83e\udd17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-PyEdu-Rs-Raw)|\\\\n|LCO Benchmark|[\ud83e\udd17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/LCO)|\\\\n\\\\nDue to our collaborators' compliance requirements, we only release the PythonEdu-Rs subset of the Annoy(++) dataset.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Models\\\\n\\\\u003ctable\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003ctr\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth rowspan=\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\"\\\\u003eBase Model / Training\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth colspan=\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\"\\\\u003eAnnoy\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth colspan=\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\"\\\\u003eAnnoy++\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003c/tr\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003ctr\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 1\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 2\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 1\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 2\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003c/tr\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003ctr\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003ctd\\\\u003eQwen 2.5 7B Coder\\\\u003c/td\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003ctd style=\\\\\\\"text-align: center;

You can choose either way to setup the environment.\\\\n```\\\\nconda create -n spec_exec python 3.11\\\\nconda activate spec_exec\\\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\\\n```\\\\nor\\\\n```\\\\nconda env create -f environment.yaml --name spec_exec\\\\nconda activate spec_exec\\\\n```\\\\nPlease note that our setup does not guarantee the execution of all types of Python code; you may need to update the environment to meet your personal requirements when processing different code files.\\\\n\\\\n### Data Processing\\\\n\\\\nWe provide a complete guide for you to build data for Annoy on a toy dataset. After all these steps you can get a dataset with the same format as in our [huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-Pyedu-Rs).\\\\n\\\\nAll intermediate results will be stored under `./data`.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 1: Convert raw code files into the unified format.\\\\n\\\\n##### Step 1.1: Build Messages\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/build_transform_msg.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--raw_code_file data/rawcode_1k.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--raw_code_msg_file data/rawcode_1k_msg.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 1.2: Inference\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/batched_api_inference.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input data/rawcode_1k_msg.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output data/rawcode_1k_unified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--model deepseek-chat \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_process 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_thread 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--key \\\\u003cyour key\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\n--temperature 0.7 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--max_tokens 4096\\\\n```\\\\nYou can also use GPT series models to do this transformation step, since recently the DeepSeek API is under heavy pressure. For example, set `--model` as `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\u200b` and change `--key` accordingly.\\\\nYou may find some the requests failed, it's OK and we just skip them.\\\\n\\\\n*Note that we only provide the code to inference with OpenAI-style APIs. However, it is also 100\\\\\\\\% feasible to deploy other open-source models and inference locally via frameworks like [vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) or [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang). Please refer to their official websites for more details.\\\\n#### Step 2: Parse \\\\u0026 Generate I/O Pairs\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/parse_gen_ios.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input_file data/rawcode_1k_unified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file data/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--python_path \\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\n--run_path \\\\\\\"./temp/temp/temp\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\nThe `--python_path` is the python path you will use to run the I/O pair generation code, which can be different from what you use in the main workflow, e.g., installed with some specific packages. The `--run_path` is the path where the I/O pair generation code will be executed, since sometimes it will store some temp files in the file systems, so we explicitly assign a place for it to save them.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 3: Build Input-Output Prediction Instances\\\\nWe only pick 3 input prediction and 3 output prediction instances for each sample.\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/build_spec_msg.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input_file data/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file data/spec_1k_msg.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 4: Inference on Annoy data\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/batched_api_inference.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input data/spec_1k_msg.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output data/spec_1k_gens.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--model deepseek-chat \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_process 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_thread 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--key \\\\u003cyour key\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\n--temperature 0.7 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--max_tokens 4096\\\\n```\\\\n#### Step 5: Verification\\\\n```\\\\nbash ./scripts/pipeline_check.sh \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\npython \\\\\\\\\\\\n./temp/temp/temp\\\\n```\\\\nIn the bash script we run the verification for several times to try our best avoid the runtime effect brought by multi-processing execution (e.g. timeout). This is helpful for large scale verification. You can change the number of process to match your machine (e.g. more if you have a large number of CPUs and a large memory).\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 6: Second Turn - Revision and Re-verification\\\\n##### Step 6.1: Build Multi-turn Messages\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/build_spec_rev_msg.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input_file data/spec_1k_gens_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file data/spec_1k_msg_rev.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 6.2: Re-generate\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/batched_api_inference.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input data/spec_1k_msg_rev.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output data/spec_1k_gens_rev.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--model deepseek-chat \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_process 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_thread 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--key \\\\u003cyour key\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\n--temperature 0.7 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--max_tokens 4096\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 6.3: Re-verification\\\\n```\\\\nbash ./scripts/pipeline_check.sh \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens_rev.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens_rev_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\npython \\\\\\\\\\\\n./temp/temp/temp\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 6.4: Final Data\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/assemble_spec_demo.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--result_file_turn1 data/spec_1k_gens_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--result_file_turn2 data/spec_1k_gens_rev_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file spec_demo_final.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\nBy doing so, you can get data `data/spec_demo_final.jsonl` with the same format as in our [huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-Pyedu-Rs).\\\\n\\\\n### Training\\\\nYou can use any popular training framework to train your model like [llama-factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory). \\\\n\\\\n## Acknowledgement\\\\nWe thank Koala NN, TCLV and OMEN for their valuable feedback and suggestions! \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\\\\n\\\",\\\"download_url\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/main/README.md\\\",\\\"encoding\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"git_url\\\":\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/git/blobs/13f2aff77b16083162e2d09d3c21c92e8c5b2039\\\",\\\"html_url\\\":\\\"https://github.com/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/blob/main/README.md\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"README.md\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"README.md\\\",\\\"sha\\\":\\\"13f2aff77b16083162e2d09d3c21c92e8c5b2039\\\",\\\"size\\\":9748,\\\"type\\\":\\\"file\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/contents/README.md?ref=main\\\"}\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01XTz5uzmkNeiL7Fo7exDi8s"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now I can see the datasets mentioned in the README.

Thus, we adopt a fully LLM-based approach for synthesizing all the desired responses using DeepSeek-V2.5, as it has top-tier performance but extremely low cost compared to other advanced LLMs.\\n\\n\\\\*Due to our collaborators' compliance requirements, we only release the PythonEdu-Rs subset (this page) of full dataset.\\n\\nDownloads last month\\n\\n\\\\-\\n\\nSystem theme\\n\\nCompany\\n\\n[TOS](/terms-of-service) [Privacy](/privacy) [About](/huggingface) [Jobs](https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/)[](/)\\n\\nWebsite\\n\\n[Models](/models) [Datasets](/datasets) [Spaces](/spaces) [Pricing](/pricing) [Docs](/docs)\\n\\nimport(\\\"\\\\\\\\/front\\\\\\\\/build\\\\\\\\/kube-0e1a2e5\\\\\\\\/index.js\\\"); window.moonSha = \\\"kube-0e1a2e5\\\\\\\\/\\\"; window.\\\\_\\\\_hf\\\\_deferred = {}; if (\\\\[\\\"hf.co\\\", \\\"huggingface.co\\\"\\\\].includes(window.location.hostname)) { const script = document.createElement(\\\"script\\\"); script.src = \\\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/\\\"; script.async = true; document.head.appendChild(script); }\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01VwPyE2xhkj6UCNpB4ug3Ji"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can see that both datasets are based on data from the HuggingFaceTB team.

Included 30 programming languages and 18 permissive licenses. **Note:** Three included licenses (MPL/EPL/LGPL) are considered weak copyleft licenses. The resulting near-deduplicated dataset is 3TB in size.\\n\\nv1.1\\n\\nThe three copyleft licenses ((MPL/EPL/LGPL) were excluded and the list of permissive licenses extended to 193 licenses in total. The list of programming languages was increased from 30 to 358 languages. Also opt-out request submitted by 15.11.2022 were excluded from this verison of the dataset. The resulting near-deduplicated dataset is 6TB in size.\\n\\nv1.2\\n\\nOpt-out request submitted by 09.02.2023 were excluded from this verison of the dataset as well as initially flagged malicious files (not exhaustive).\\n\\n### [](#dataset-summary)Dataset Summary\\n\\nThe Stack contains over 6TB of permissively-licensed source code files covering 358 programming languages. The dataset was created as part of the [BigCode Project](https://www.bigcode-project.org/), an open scientific collaboration working on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs). The Stack serves as a pre-training dataset for Code LLMs, i.e., code-generating AI systems which enable the synthesis of programs from natural language descriptions as well as other from code snippets.\\n\\n### [](#supported-tasks-and-leaderboards)Supported Tasks and Leaderboards\\n\\nThe Stack is a pre-training dataset for creating code LLMs. Code LLMs can be used for a wide variety of downstream tasks such as code completion from natural language descriptions ([HumanEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai_humaneval), [MBPP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mbpp)), documentation generation for individual functions ([CodeSearchNet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/code_search_net)), and auto-completion of code snippets ([HumanEval-Infilling](https://github.com/openai/human-eval-infilling)). However, these downstream evaluation benchmarks are outside the scope of The Stack.\\n\\n### [](#languages)Languages\\n\\nThe following natural languages appear in the comments and docstrings from files in the dataset: EN, ZH, FR, PT, ES, RU, DE, KO, JA, UZ, IT, ID, RO, AR, FA, CA, HU, ML, NL, TR, TE, EL, EO, BN, LV, GL, PL, GU, CEB, IA, KN, SH, MK, UR, SV, LA, JKA, MY, SU, CS, MN. This kind of data is essential for applications such as documentation generation and natural-language-to-code translation.\\n\\nThe dataset contains **358 programming languages**.

The content of the file is in the `content` feature, and other features (`repository_name`, `licenses`, etc.) provide some metadata. Note that a given file can appear in several different repositories that satisfy our safe-license criterion. If that is the case, only the first \u2013 in alphabetical order -- of these repositories is shown for simplicity.\\n\\n### [](#data-fields)Data Fields\\n\\n*   `content` (string): the content of the file.\\n*   `size` (integer): size of the uncompressed file.\\n*   `lang` (string): the programming language.\\n*   `ext` (string): file extension\\n*   `avg_line_length` (float): the average line-length of the file.\\n*   `max_line_length` (integer): the maximum line-length of the file.\\n*   `alphanum_fraction` (float): the fraction of characters in the file that are alphabetical or numerical characters.\\n*   `hexsha` (string): unique git hash of file\\n*   `max_{stars|forks|issues}_repo_path` (string): path to file in repo containing this file with maximum number of `{stars|forks|issues}`\\n*   `max_{stars|forks|issues}_repo_name` (string): name of repo containing this file with maximum number of `{stars|forks|issues}`\\n*   `max_{stars|forks|issues}_repo_head_hexsha` (string): hexsha of repository head\\n*   `max_{stars|forks|issues}_repo_licenses` (string): licenses in repository\\n*   `max_{stars|forks|issues}_count` (integer): number of `{stars|forks|issues}` in repository\\n*   `max_{stars|forks|issues}_repo_{stars|forks|issues}_min_datetime` (string): first timestamp of a `{stars|forks|issues}` event\\n*   `max_{stars|forks|issues}_repo_{stars|forks|issues}_max_datetime` (string): last timestamp of a `{stars|forks|issues}` event\\n\\n### [](#data-splits)Data Splits\\n\\nThe dataset has no splits and all data is loaded as train split by default. If you want to setup a custom train-test split beware that dataset contains a lot of near-duplicates which can cause leakage into the test split.\\n\\n[](#dataset-creation)Dataset Creation\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n### [](#curation-rationale)Curation Rationale\\n\\nOne of the challenges faced by researchers working on code LLMs is the lack of openness and transparency around the development of these systems. Most prior works described the high-level data collection process but did not release the training data. It is therefore difficult for other researchers to fully reproduce these models and understand what kind of pre-training data leads to high-performing code LLMs. By releasing an open large-scale code dataset we hope to make training of code LLMs more reproducible.\\n\\n### [](#source-data)Source Data\\n\\n#### [](#initial-data-collection-and-normalization)Initial Data Collection and Normalization\\n\\n220.92M active GitHub repository names were collected from the event archives published between January 1st, 2015 and March 31st, 2022 on [GHArchive](https://gharchive.org/). Only 137.36M of these repositories were public and accessible on GitHub \u2013 others were not accessible as they had been deleted by their owners. 51.76B files were downloaded from the public repositories on GitHub between November 2021 and June 2022. 5.28B files were unique. The uncompressed size of all stored files is 92.36TB.\\n\\nThe list of programming language extensions is taken from this [list](https://gist.github.com/ppisarczyk/43962d06686722d26d176fad46879d41) (also provided in Appendix C of the paper).\\n\\nNear-deduplication was implemented in the pre-processing pipeline on top of exact deduplication. To find near-duplicates, MinHash with 256 permutations of all documents was computed in linear time. Locality Sensitive Hashing was used to find the clusters of duplicates. Jaccard Similarities were computed inside these clusters to remove any false positives and with a similarity threshold of 0.85. Roughly 40% of permissively licensed files were (near-)duplicates. See section 3 of the paper for further details.\\n\\nThe following are not stored:\\n\\n*   Files that cannot contribute to training code: binary, empty, could not be decoded\\n*   Files larger than 1MB\\n*   The excluded file extensions are listed in Appendix B of the paper.\\n\\n##### [](#license-detection)License detection\\n\\nPermissive licenses have minimal restrictions on how the software can be copied, modified, and redistributed. The full list of licenses can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack-dedup/blob/main/licenses.json).\\n\\nGHArchive contained the license information for approximately 12% of the collected repositories. For the remaining repositories, [go-license-detector](https://github.com/src-d/go-license-detector) was run to detect the most likely SPDX license identifier. The detector did not detect a license for ~81% of the repositories, in which case the repository was excluded from the dataset.\\n\\nA file was included in the safe license dataset if at least one of the repositories containing the file had a permissive license.\\n\\n#### [](#who-are-the-source-language-producers)Who are the source language producers?\\n\\nThe source (code) language producers are users of GitHub that created unique repository names between January 1st, 2015, and March 31st, 2022.\\n\\n### [](#personal-and-sensitive-information)Personal and Sensitive Information\\n\\nThe released dataset may contain sensitive information such as emails, IP addresses, and API/ssh keys that have previously been published to public repositories on GitHub. Deduplication has helped to reduce the amount of sensitive data that may exist. In the event that the dataset contains personal information, researchers should only use public, non-personal information in support of conducting and publishing their [open-access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) research. Personal information should not be used for spamming purposes, including sending unsolicited emails or selling of personal information. Complaints, removal requests, and \\\"do not contact\\\" requests can be sent to [contact@bigcode-project.org](mailto:contact@bigcode-project.org).\\n\\nThe PII pipeline for this dataset is still a work in progress (see this [issue](https://github.com/bigcode-project/admin/issues/9) for updates). Researchers that wish to contribute to the anonymization pipeline of the project can apply to join [here](https://www.bigcode-project.org/docs/about/join/). Developers with source code in the dataset can request to have it removed [here](https://www.bigcode-project.org/docs/about/ip/) (proof of code contribution is required).\\n\\n### [](#opting-out-of-the-stack)Opting out of The Stack\\n\\nWe are giving developers the ability to have their code removed from the dataset upon request. The process for submitting and enacting removal requests will keep evolving throughout the project as we receive feedback and build up more data governance tools.\\n\\nYou can check if your code is in The Stack with the following [\\\"Am I In The Stack?\\\" Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/in-the-stack). If you'd like to have your data removed from the dataset follow the [instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/bigcode-project/opt-out-v2).\\n\\n[](#considerations-for-using-the-data)Considerations for Using the Data\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [](#social-impact-of-dataset)Social Impact of Dataset\\n\\nThe Stack is an output of the BigCode Project. BigCode aims to be responsible by design and by default. The project is conducted in the spirit of Open Science, focused on the responsible development of LLMs for code.\\n\\nWith the release of The Stack, we aim to increase access, reproducibility, and transparency of code LLMs in the research community. Work to de-risk and improve on the implementation of ethical best practices of code LLMs is conducted in various BigCode working groups. The Legal, Ethics, and Governance working group has explored topics such as licensing (including copyleft and the intended use of permissively licensed code), attribution of generated code to original code, rights to restrict processing, the inclusion of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and risks of malicious code, among other topics. This work is ongoing as of October 25th, 2022.\\n\\nWe expect code LLMs to enable people from diverse backgrounds to write higher quality code and develop low-code applications. Mission-critical software could become easier to maintain as professional developers are guided by code-generating systems on how to write more robust and efficient code. While the social impact is intended to be positive, the increased accessibility of code LLMs comes with certain risks such as over-reliance on the generated code and long-term effects on the software development job market.\\n\\nA broader impact analysis relating to Code LLMs can be found in section 7 of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374). An in-depth risk assessments for Code LLMs can be found in section 4 of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14157).\\n\\n### [](#discussion-of-biases)Discussion of Biases\\n\\nThe code collected from GitHub does not contain demographic information or proxy information about the demographics. However, it is not without risks, as the comments within the code may contain harmful or offensive language, which could be learned by the models.\\n\\nWidely adopted programming languages like C and Javascript are overrepresented compared to niche programming languages like Julia and Scala. Some programming languages such as SQL, Batchfile, TypeScript are less likely to be permissively licensed (4% vs the average 10%). This may result in a biased representation of those languages. Permissively licensed files also tend to be longer.\\n\\nRoughly 40 natural languages are present in docstrings and comments with English being the most prevalent. In python files, it makes up ~96% of the dataset.\\n\\nFor further information on data analysis of the Stack, see this [repo](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-analysis).\\n\\n### [](#other-known-limitations)Other Known Limitations\\n\\nOne of the current limitations of The Stack is that scraped HTML for websites may not be compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)). This could have an impact on HTML-generated code that may introduce web accessibility issues.\\n\\nThe training dataset could contain malicious code and/or the model could be used to generate malware or ransomware.\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, all files contained in the dataset are licensed with one of the permissive licenses (see list in [Licensing information](#licensing-information)). The accuracy of license attribution is limited by the accuracy of GHArchive and go-license-detector. Any mistakes should be reported to BigCode Project for review and follow-up as needed.\\n\\n[](#additional-information)Additional Information\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [](#dataset-curators)Dataset Curators\\n\\n1.

StarCoderData is based on \"The Stack\" dataset from BigCode\n4. \"The Stack\" has very clear terms of use that state: \"The Stack is a collection of source code from repositories with various licenses. Any use of all or part of the code gathered in The Stack must abide by the terms of the original licenses, including attribution clauses when relevant.\"\n\nThe key insight is that \"The Stack\" explicitly states that users must abide by the terms of the original licenses of the source repositories. Since the dataset contains code from repositories with \"various licenses\" and includes \"permissive licenses\" (193 different permissive licenses according to the documentation), the most appropriate license to use would be the most permissive one that allows derivative works.\n\nLooking at the license information, \"The Stack\" contains code from repositories with permissive licenses.
