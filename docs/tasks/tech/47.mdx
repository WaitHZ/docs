## Instruction

I'm trying to reproduce the experiments from a deep learning paper (paper.pdf). Unfortunately, the paper does not provide an official implementation code repository. To work more efficiently, please help me find the unofficial implementation repository with the most stars on GitHub and update the existing `result.json` with the information.

Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating
compute in transformer-based language
models

Transformer-based language models spread FLOPs uniformly across input sequences. In this work we
demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute ) to specific
positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the
model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens ( 𝑘) that
can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed
are determined by the network using a top- 𝑘routing mechanism. Since 𝑘is defined a priori, this
simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional
computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the 𝑘tokens are fluid, this method can
expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure
is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do
models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models
match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of
the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50% faster to step during post-training sampling.
1. Introduction
Notallproblemsrequirethesameamountoftimeorefforttosolve. Analogously, inlanguagemodeling
not all tokens and sequences require the same time or effort to accurately make a prediction. And
yet, transformer models expend the same amount of compute per token in a forward pass. Ideally,
transformers would use smaller total compute budgets by not spending compute unnecessarily.
Conditional computation is a technique that tries to reduce total compute by expending it only
when needed (Bengio et al., 2016; Bengio, 2013; Bengio et al., 2013). Various algorithms offer
solutions to when and how much compute should be used (Ainslie et al., 2023; Bapna et al., 2020;
Fedus et al., 2022). However, general formulations of this challenging problem may not work well with
existing hardware constraints since they tend to introduce dynamic computation graphs (Dehghani
et al., 2018; Graves, 2016). The most promising conditional computation methods may instead be
those that are harmonious with our current hardware stack, which prioritizes static computation
graphs, and known tensor sizes that are selected to maximize hardware utilization.
Here we consider the problem of language modeling using a staticcompute budget that can be
made less than that used by a vanilla transformer. The network must learn how to dynamically allocate
the available compute by making decisions per-token, in each layer, about where to spend compute
from the available budget. In our implementation total compute is user defined and unchanging
prior to training, rather than being a function of the network’s on-the-fly decisions. Thus, hardware
efficiency gains—such as reduced memory footprint, or reduced FLOPs per forward pass—can be
anticipated and exploited ahead of time. As we will show, these gains can be had without sacrificing
overall performance.

Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models
We leverage an approach akin to Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers, in which dynamic
token-level routing decisions are made across the network depth. Departing from MoE, we choose
to either apply a computation to a token (as would be the case for a standard transformer), or pass
it through a residual connection (remaining unchanged and saving compute). Also in contrast to
MoE, we apply this routing to both forward MLPs and multi-head attention. Since this therefore
also impacts the keys and queries we process, the routing makes decisions not only about which
tokens to update, but also which tokens are made available to attend to. We refer to this strategy
as Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) to emphasize how individual tokens pass through different numbers of
layers, or blocks, through the depth of the transformer (see figure 1).
The MoD technique also allows one to trade-off performance with speed. On the one hand, one
can train an MoD transformer that improves upon vanilla transformers by as much as 1.5%on the
final log probability training objective for equivalent training FLOPs (isoFLOP), and while taking an
equivalent amount of wall-clock time to train. On the other hand, one can train an MoD transformer
that achieves training loss parity with an isoFLOP optimal vanilla transformer, but which uses a
fraction of the FLOPs (upwards of 50%) per forward pass, and hence is faster to step. Together, these
results imply that MoD transformers learn to route intelligently (i.e., skipping computations that are
unnecessary) since they can achieve equal or better log probabilities per sequence despite a smaller
FLOP footprint per forward pass.
2. Background
The transformer architecture has become the workhorse of a revolution in practical artificial in-
telligence, bringing unprecedented capabilities at the cost of expensive training runs and serving
procedures. This has spurred tremendous interest in making transformer architectures more effi-
cient (Gupta and Agrawal, 2021; Tay et al., 2020). One of the promising approaches is conditional
computation , whereby learned mechanisms determine when and how to expend computation. This
terminology was introduced by Bengio (2013), and the concept was explored further over the next
several years (Bengio et al., 2016, 2013; Cho and Bengio, 2014; Graves, 2016; Jernite et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017).
A wide variety of recent work has developed conditional computation methods for transformers.
Some of this work focuses on "early exiting", that is, learning to decide when to end computation on
a given token, allowing the token to skip any remaining transformer layers after the exit decision
is made (Elbayad et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Schuster et al., 2022). In MoD, unlike in early-exit
methods, a token can skip middle layers, then be updated via self-attention with tokens that that
have gone through all the middle layers. We speculate that this might be a useful property.
Other work has developed methods for iterating transformer layers with shared weights for
an adaptive number of steps (Dehghani et al., 2018; Simoulin and Crabbé, 2021). Bolya et al.
(2023) developed a method for choosing tokens to merge when running inference on a trained vision
transformer which notably requires no learning. Lei et al. (2023) make use of conditional computation
in a fine tuning setting by building on adapter approaches (He et al., 2021) to learn to skip blocks of
frozen pre-trained weights in favor of running only a small fine-tuned adapter.
CoLT5 (Ainslie et al., 2023) uses conditional routing to select whether a given token will pass
through a heavy or light pathway for each feedforward layer. Further, they use the same routing
mechanism to select whether a token will attend to all other tokens or to a select few, as in Guo et al.
(2022). Like MoD, CoLT5 uses soft top-k for making routing decisions. However, CoLT5 focuses on
a encoder-decoder setting, and thus does need to contend with the problem of efficient sequential
decoding given the non-causal nature of the top-k operation. In contrast, our current work with

Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating
compute in transformer-based language
models

Transformer-based language models spread FLOPs uniformly across input sequences. In this work we
demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute ) to specific
positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the
model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens ( 𝑘) that
can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed
are determined by the network using a top- 𝑘routing mechanism. Since 𝑘is defined a priori, this
simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional
computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the 𝑘tokens are fluid, this method can
expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure
is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do
models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models
match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of
the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50% faster to step during post-training sampling.
1. Introduction
Notallproblemsrequirethesameamountoftimeorefforttosolve. Analogously, inlanguagemodeling
not all tokens and sequences require the same time or effort to accurately make a prediction. And
yet, transformer models expend the same amount of compute per token in a forward pass. Ideally,
transformers would use smaller total compute budgets by not spending compute unnecessarily.
Conditional computation is a technique that tries to reduce total compute by expending it only
when needed (Bengio et al., 2016; Bengio, 2013; Bengio et al., 2013). Various algorithms offer
solutions to when and how much compute should be used (Ainslie et al., 2023; Bapna et al., 2020;
Fedus et al., 2022). However, general formulations of this challenging problem may not work well with
existing hardware constraints since they tend to introduce dynamic computation graphs (Dehghani
et al., 2018; Graves, 2016). The most promising conditional computation methods may instead be
those that are harmonious with our current hardware stack, which prioritizes static computation
graphs, and known tensor sizes that are selected to maximize hardware utilization.
Here we consider the problem of language modeling using a staticcompute budget that can be
made less than that used by a vanilla transformer. The network must learn how to dynamically allocate
the available compute by making decisions per-token, in each layer, about where to spend compute
from the available budget. In our implementation total compute is user defined and unchanging
prior to training, rather than being a function of the network’s on-the-fly decisions. Thus, hardware
efficiency gains—such as reduced memory footprint, or reduced FLOPs per forward pass—can be
anticipated and exploited ahead of time. As we will show, these gains can be had without sacrificing
overall performance.

Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models
We leverage an approach akin to Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers, in which dynamic
token-level routing decisions are made across the network depth. Departing from MoE, we choose
to either apply a computation to a token (as would be the case for a standard transformer), or pass
it through a residual connection (remaining unchanged and saving compute). Also in contrast to
MoE, we apply this routing to both forward MLPs and multi-head attention. Since this therefore
also impacts the keys and queries we process, the routing makes decisions not only about which
tokens to update, but also which tokens are made available to attend to. We refer to this strategy
as Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) to emphasize how individual tokens pass through different numbers of
layers, or blocks, through the depth of the transformer (see figure 1).
The MoD technique also allows one to trade-off performance with speed. On the one hand, one
can train an MoD transformer that improves upon vanilla transformers by as much as 1.5%on the
final log probability training objective for equivalent training FLOPs (isoFLOP), and while taking an
equivalent amount of wall-clock time to train. On the other hand, one can train an MoD transformer
that achieves training loss parity with an isoFLOP optimal vanilla transformer, but which uses a
fraction of the FLOPs (upwards of 50%) per forward pass, and hence is faster to step. Together, these
results imply that MoD transformers learn to route intelligently (i.e., skipping computations that are
unnecessary) since they can achieve equal or better log probabilities per sequence despite a smaller
FLOP footprint per forward pass.
2. Background
The transformer architecture has become the workhorse of a revolution in practical artificial in-
telligence, bringing unprecedented capabilities at the cost of expensive training runs and serving
procedures. This has spurred tremendous interest in making transformer architectures more effi-
cient (Gupta and Agrawal, 2021; Tay et al., 2020). One of the promising approaches is conditional
computation , whereby learned mechanisms determine when and how to expend computation. This
terminology was introduced by Bengio (2013), and the concept was explored further over the next
several years (Bengio et al., 2016, 2013; Cho and Bengio, 2014; Graves, 2016; Jernite et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017).
A wide variety of recent work has developed conditional computation methods for transformers.
Some of this work focuses on "early exiting", that is, learning to decide when to end computation on
a given token, allowing the token to skip any remaining transformer layers after the exit decision
is made (Elbayad et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Schuster et al., 2022). In MoD, unlike in early-exit
methods, a token can skip middle layers, then be updated via self-attention with tokens that that
have gone through all the middle layers. We speculate that this might be a useful property.
Other work has developed methods for iterating transformer layers with shared weights for
an adaptive number of steps (Dehghani et al., 2018; Simoulin and Crabbé, 2021). Bolya et al.
(2023) developed a method for choosing tokens to merge when running inference on a trained vision
transformer which notably requires no learning. Lei et al. (2023) make use of conditional computation
in a fine tuning setting by building on adapter approaches (He et al., 2021) to learn to skip blocks of
frozen pre-trained weights in favor of running only a small fine-tuned adapter.
CoLT5 (Ainslie et al., 2023) uses conditional routing to select whether a given token will pass
through a heavy or light pathway for each feedforward layer. Further, they use the same routing
mechanism to select whether a token will attend to all other tokens or to a select few, as in Guo et al.
(2022). Like MoD, CoLT5 uses soft top-k for making routing decisions. However, CoLT5 focuses on
a encoder-decoder setting, and thus does need to contend with the problem of efficient sequential
decoding given the non-causal nature of the top-k operation. In contrast, our current work with

Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models
Figure 1|Mixture-of-Depths Transformer. As in mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformers we use a
router to choose among potential computational paths. But unlike in MoE transformers the possible
choices are a standard block’s computation (i.e., self-attention and MLP) or a residual connection.
Since some tokens take this second route, Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) transformers have a smaller
total FLOP footprint compared to vanilla or MoE transformers. On the top right is depicted a trained
model’sroutingdecisionsforashortsequencetruncatedto64tokensforvisualizationpurposes. When
examining the choices one can find tokens processed by later blocks’ layers, despite passing through
relatively few total blocks throughout the model’s depth. This is a unique feature of MoD compared
to conventional halting-based, or "early-exit" conditional computation, which instead engage blocks
serially, or vanilla transformers, which engage every block.
MoD focuses on the decoder-only setting, and so we propose a predictive router to enable efficient
inference for conditional computation in transformers.
One successful formulation of conditional computation is the the "mixture-of-experts" layer (MoE)
as introduced by Shazeer et al. (2017). Developed initially in the context of LSTMs, later work showed
compelling empirical results for MoE with transformers (Fedus et al., 2022; Lepikhin et al., 2020;
Zoph et al., 2022). Unlike other conditional computation approaches that try to conserve or expend
additional compute, MoE transformers use conditional logic to route tokens to one of many expert
MLPs while keeping total compute expenditure constant. Our mixture-of-depths method can be
thought of as using the routing logic from MoE transformers, but rather than having multiple experts,
MoD deploys a single expert which can be dynamically skipped.
3. Implementing Mixture-of-Depths Transformers
Our high-level strategy is as follows:
•Set a static compute budget that is less than that of an equivalent vanilla transformer by limiting

Transformer-based language models spread FLOPs uniformly across input sequences. In this work we
demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute ) to specific
positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the
model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens ( 𝑘) that
can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed
are determined by the network using a top- 𝑘routing mechanism. Since 𝑘is defined a priori, this
simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional
computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the 𝑘tokens are fluid, this method can
expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure
is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do
models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models
match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of
the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50% faster to step during post-training sampling.
1. Introduction
Notallproblemsrequirethesameamountoftimeorefforttosolve. Analogously, inlanguagemodeling
not all tokens and sequences require the same time or effort to accurately make a prediction. And
yet, transformer models expend the same amount of compute per token in a forward pass. Ideally,
transformers would use smaller total compute budgets by not spending compute unnecessarily.
Conditional computation is a technique that tries to reduce total compute by expending it only
when needed (Bengio et al., 2016; Bengio, 2013; Bengio et al., 2013). Various algorithms offer
solutions to when and how much compute should be used (Ainslie et al., 2023; Bapna et al., 2020;
Fedus et al., 2022). However, general formulations of this challenging problem may not work well with
existing hardware constraints since they tend to introduce dynamic computation graphs (Dehghani
et al., 2018; Graves, 2016). The most promising conditional computation methods may instead be
those that are harmonious with our current hardware stack, which prioritizes static computation
graphs, and known tensor sizes that are selected to maximize hardware utilization.
Here we consider the problem of language modeling using a staticcompute budget that can be
made less than that used by a vanilla transformer. The network must learn how to dynamically allocate
the available compute by making decisions per-token, in each layer, about where to spend compute
from the available budget. In our implementation total compute is user defined and unchanging
prior to training, rather than being a function of the network’s on-the-fly decisions. Thus, hardware
efficiency gains—such as reduced memory footprint, or reduced FLOPs per forward pass—can be
anticipated and exploited ahead of time. As we will show, these gains can be had without sacrificing
overall performance.

Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models
We leverage an approach akin to Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers, in which dynamic
token-level routing decisions are made across the network depth. Departing from MoE, we choose
to either apply a computation to a token (as would be the case for a standard transformer), or pass
it through a residual connection (remaining unchanged and saving compute). Also in contrast to
MoE, we apply this routing to both forward MLPs and multi-head attention. Since this therefore
also impacts the keys and queries we process, the routing makes decisions not only about which
tokens to update, but also which tokens are made available to attend to. We refer to this strategy
as Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) to emphasize how individual tokens pass through different numbers of
layers, or blocks, through the depth of the transformer (see figure 1).
The MoD technique also allows one to trade-off performance with speed. On the one hand, one
can train an MoD transformer that improves upon vanilla transformers by as much as 1.5%on the
final log probability training objective for equivalent training FLOPs (isoFLOP), and while taking an
equivalent amount of wall-clock time to train. On the other hand, one can train an MoD transformer
that achieves training loss parity with an isoFLOP optimal vanilla transformer, but which uses a
fraction of the FLOPs (upwards of 50%) per forward pass, and hence is faster to step. Together, these
results imply that MoD transformers learn to route intelligently (i.e., skipping computations that are
unnecessary) since they can achieve equal or better log probabilities per sequence despite a smaller
FLOP footprint per forward pass.
2. Background
The transformer architecture has become the workhorse of a revolution in practical artificial in-
telligence, bringing unprecedented capabilities at the cost of expensive training runs and serving
procedures. This has spurred tremendous interest in making transformer architectures more effi-
cient (Gupta and Agrawal, 2021; Tay et al., 2020). One of the promising approaches is conditional
computation , whereby learned mechanisms determine when and how to expend computation. This
terminology was introduced by Bengio (2013), and the concept was explored further over the next
several years (Bengio et al., 2016, 2013; Cho and Bengio, 2014; Graves, 2016; Jernite et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017).
A wide variety of recent work has developed conditional computation methods for transformers.
Some of this work focuses on "early exiting", that is, learning to decide when to end computation on
a given token, allowing the token to skip any remaining transformer layers after the exit decision
is made (Elbayad et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Schuster et al., 2022). In MoD, unlike in early-exit
methods, a token can skip middle layers, then be updated via self-attention with tokens that that
have gone through all the middle layers. We speculate that this might be a useful property.
Other work has developed methods for iterating transformer layers with shared weights for
an adaptive number of steps (Dehghani et al., 2018; Simoulin and Crabbé, 2021). Bolya et al.
(2023) developed a method for choosing tokens to merge when running inference on a trained vision
transformer which notably requires no learning. Lei et al. (2023) make use of conditional computation
in a fine tuning setting by building on adapter approaches (He et al., 2021) to learn to skip blocks of
frozen pre-trained weights in favor of running only a small fine-tuned adapter.
CoLT5 (Ainslie et al., 2023) uses conditional routing to select whether a given token will pass
through a heavy or light pathway for each feedforward layer. Further, they use the same routing
mechanism to select whether a token will attend to all other tokens or to a select few, as in Guo et al.
(2022). Like MoD, CoLT5 uses soft top-k for making routing decisions. However, CoLT5 focuses on
a encoder-decoder setting, and thus does need to contend with the problem of efficient sequential
decoding given the non-causal nature of the top-k operation. In contrast, our current work with

I found the most-starred unofficial implementation on GitHub for the paper “Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models” and updated result.json accordingly.

Top unofficial repo:
- https://github.com/astramind-ai/Mixture-of-depths (most stars among Mixture-of-Depths unofficial implementations)

result.json has been updated to:
\{
    "URL": "https://github.com/astramind-ai/Mixture-of-depths"
