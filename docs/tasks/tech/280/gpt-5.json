The first step is to prepare pre-training data, so I need your help organizing the pre-training data for llama and gpt-neo into the `ptdata` sheet in `LLM Pre-training Data` spreadsheet. The pre-training data should be sorted in descending order by data size, with columns named `name`, `use in llm` (the value should only include llama and gpt-neo; if used by both models, it should be either gpt-neo or llama), `size` (the numeric value in GB, but do not include \"GB\" in cell), and `link` in order. The link to huggingface is preferred; if huggingface doesn't have the dataset, we'll try to provide other links."

Systematic review of the published literature. Out-patient clinics, emergency departments and hospitalisation wards in 23 health centres from 10 countries. Cohort studies reporting the frequency of hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Prevalence of hypoxaemia measured in children with ARI and relative risks for the association between the severity of illness and the frequency of hypoxaemia, and between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Seventeen published studies were found that included 4,021 children under 5 with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and reported the prevalence of hypoxaemia. Out-patient children and those with a clinical diagnosis of upper ARI had a low risk of hypoxaemia (pooled estimate of 6% to 9%). The prevalence increased to 31% and to 43% in patients in emergency departments and in cases with clinical pneumonia, respectively, and it was even higher among hospitalised children (47%) and in those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (72%). The cumulated data also suggest that hypoxaemia is more frequent in children living at high altitude. Three papers reported an association between hypoxaemia and death, with relative risks varying between 1.4 and 4.6. Papers describing predictors of hypoxaemia have focused on clinical signs for detecting hypoxaemia rather than on identifying risk factors for developing this complication. Hypoxaemia is a common and potentially lethal complication of ALRI in children under 5, particularly among those with severe disease and those living at high altitude. Given the observed high prevalence of hypoxaemia and its likely association with increased mortality, efforts should be made to improve the detection of hypoxaemia and to provide oxygen earlier to more children with severe ALRI.'\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n#### [](#pubmed_central)pubmed\\\\_central\\n\\n    {\\n      'meta': \\\"{id': 'PMC5595690'}\\\",\\n      'text': 'Introduction {#acel12642-sec-0001}\\\\n============\\\\n\\\\nAlzheimer\\\\\\\\\\\\'s disease (AD), the most common cause of...'\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n#### [](#ubuntu_irc)ubuntu\\\\_irc\\n\\n    {\\n      'text': \\\"#ubuntu 2004-07-05\\\\n* Window 3\\\\n* \\\\tServer: [0]  <None>\\\\n* \\\\tScreen: 0x817e90c\\\\n* \\\\tGeometry Info: [0 11 0 11 11 11] \\\\n* \\\\tCO, LI are [94 49] \\\\n* \\\\tCurrent channel: #ubuntu\\\\n* \\\\tQuery User: <None> \\\\n*\\\\tPrompt: <None>\\\\n* \\\\tSecond status line is OFF\\\\n* \\\\tSplit line is ON triple is OFF\\\\n* \\\\tLogging is ON\\\\n* \\\\tLogfile is irclogs/ubuntu.log\\\\n* \\\\tNotification is OFF\\\\n* \\\\tHold mode is OFF\\\\n* \\\\tWindow level is NONE\\\\n* \\\\tLastlog level is ALL\\\\n* \\\\tNotify level is ALL\\\\n<mdz> lifeless: using tla effectively for all packages in Warty requ...\\\",\\n      'meta': \\\"{'channel': 'ubuntu', 'month': 7}\\\"\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n#### [](#uspto)uspto\\n\\n    {\\n      'text': \\\"1.

I have a printer that I wanna buy and I want to know if it's good. Where should I post this question in order to get some smart people to take a look? Great question! 3DPrinting SE attracts a lot of new Stack Exchange network users, which unfortunately can come with questions that don't always meet the Q&A style for the network that this site tries to uphold. Questions like this are probably best asked in the Chat room. Currently, it's not very active, but hopefully if we have a few people interested in these more \\\"off-topic\\\" questions the activity will pick up. Pings are going to be a very useful tool if we're going to try and utilize the chat window more. Pinging some of the highly active users may help get quality answers to those off-topic questions. Some of your question could be acceptable. What you want to avoid is \\\"questions which are too broad, unclear, incomplete or primarily opinion-based\\\". That still leaves lots of other acceptable questions to ask like what printers have a specific feature or whether a specific printer has a specific feature. Note the word \\\"specific\\\". There is also a Hardware Recommendations SE Beta that may work for you.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.624436\\n\\n2017-03-19T18:24:14\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/219\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[\\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n236\\n\\nShould we start a 3D Printing BLOG? Do we want to add a BLOG to this site? Blogs are another way of communicating things that don't fit the Q&A model. Here is a good description of what a Blog is and how you can start one. This post on the SuperUser Blog asking for help with their Blog is helpful too. +1 - As it seems a good idea. Not sure what would go in it though - do you have any concrete examples of blog ideas? The description of blogs you've cited is 6 years old. Unfortunately, blogs have since been discontinued. It is no longer possible to start a new blog. Oh yeah... we should have checked the date! :-) Oops... that is a shame, though. I am still researching and seeing what Stack Exchange's perspective is on this whole \\\"xxx doesn't fit into the Q&A format and it is valid and belongs on your Blog instead ... which doesn't exist anymore ...\\\" oops! very inconsistent but not surprising when you get bigger and now there are silos BTW, they have decided to keep their own blog https://stackoverflow.blog/engineering/ a bit inconsistent but no surprising either. +1 - As it seems a good idea. Not sure what would go in it though - do you have any concrete examples of blog ideas? I already have a (messy) blog, and I am not sure if I could also write a blog on here too. I wonder what the score is regarding duplicating personal blogs on to SE blogs? Content An SE 3D print blog could be a good idea for Build Logs, for example, maybe. Or maybe a page that links to other people's superlative build logs, David Crocker's blogs come to mind. Is the blog (unlike the SE Q&A site) allowed to contain links to cheap items/suppliers? Apparently, reviews are allowed, from Blog Overflow: Review a product. Reviews don\u2019t fit the Q&A nature of the sites, but these rules don\u2019t apply on the blog! Between a review written by a random person on the internet and a review written by a user on the site who consistently gets a lot of upvotes, which review would you trust more? This closed question would have fitted into a blog nicely: What Is 3D Printing? Concerns So, yes, I think it would be worth starting one up and seeing how it goes... although I would be a little concerned about the regularity of posts: Plan a schedule. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be posts on Tuesdays and posts on Fridays? You don\u2019t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week. and Pick a posting schedule and stick to it. It is easier to simply keep up from the get go than catch up if you fall behind. Have a couple draft posts stashed away for a rainy day, ready to go that can be published if there is a lull. Also, who would coordinate it? Are you putting yourself forward? Have someone holding the reins. This person doesn\u2019t need to be the one writing all the posts, just someone that helps coordinate who is writing what and when it is getting posted. However, it is a bit of a misfortune that Blog Overflow has a rather unfortunately acronym (as well as sounding like Bog Overflow). I LIKE IT! Thanks for stepping up and helping the frame what the content and issues would be like. I like all the ideas regarding content. I am sure there are a lot of people in the group that could provide reviews for the printers they have and/or build logs for the printers they build/improved. I am wondering on how to manage/vet that. Is there a place where people could post and vote on BLOG topics so that everything is not on you? Ex: Post an ongoing META question \\\"What posts would people be willing to write for the BLOG\\\". Some sort of an example and/or style guide would help. @markshancock - yes, a style guide would be needed, I guess, for consistency's sake... although everyone has different writing styles. Maybe this question would suffice, w.r.t. ideas for the blog. But like I said above, getting people on board could be an issue. This Meta site seems to not to be terribly well frequented.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.624932\\n\\n2017-06-22T20:02:48\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/236\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Greenonline\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4762\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/6417\\\", \\\"markshancock\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n474\\n\\nTag Rename: lcdscreen -> lcd-screen to make reading tags easier, I propose to swap lcdscreen to lcd-screen, in line with x-axis and others.

I can delete it if you really want but it might be better to discuss/explain first to avoid confusion and people taking time to post answers which are then deleted. If you could explain why you think it is useless then it might help others to understand. It is perfectly fine to post a duplicate question. You cannot be aware of all questions, and searching sometimes does not bring up a similar question! Hence, other people mark it as duplicate. Having duplicates is very good because some problems can be described differently, this increases the chance a question is found using the search functionality! Therefore, there is no need to delete it. Also, in your question there where a bunch of side questions, which could be answered while the main problem is described in the duplicate question.

On other Stack sites it is quite common for purchasing assistance and shopping ideas to be off topic. The reason being these types of questions become outdated very quickly as technology changes, a store goes out of business, or a product is no longer available. When looking at this: Makerbot Smart extruder+ heat block and nozzle question - there is the basis for asking about Mk10/Mk11 printer heads, but they also ask about where to purchase them. Are these types of questions on-topic for 3D Printing? Asking for which type of extruder is used by this assembly is on-topic, where to buy (shopping) is off-topic. This is discussed in this question. Another question that points out the differences between \\\"shopping questions\\\" is still unanswered but discusses differences between shopping questions. Some can still be answered based on how they are formulated. Generally, \\\"where to buy stuff\\\" should be left to the OP, he can Google that himself, but what it is called/named or how does it look like or if there are printable or alternate version available are IMHO on-topic. I totally agree 100%, but I often, cheekily, provide a link or two as suggestions, just so that they know what they should be looking for. For example, the thermistor question. @Greenonline Maybe we should ask those to join in \\\\[chat\\\\] and pass that information there. Adding an image to show what they look for or describe what they look for might be an idea, but my general opinion is to not answer those questions with direct links. In the past I referred to \\\"Those typical auction sites or Chinese vendor sites\\\", or something in that line. I guess most people will understand where to get it then... Yeah, good points. I think that adding an image is harmless, but if new people see links in my answers, I guess then they might feel encouraged to ask a question hoping that someone will answer and provide a sneaky link - point taken, I hadn't given it much thought, tbh. I suppose that it never pays to be overly helpful. :-)\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.626823\\n\\n2018-10-22T12:54:33\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/357\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"0scar\\\", \\\"Greenonline\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4762\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/5740\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n384\\n\\nAdvertising on other SE sites: 2019 Version It is open season for posting ads on other sites. It might be a good idea to take advantage of this to help 3dPrinting.SE grow. I'm wondering what everyone might think about it? If it does interest you, please post up an answer to this question with where you might think would be a good place to advertise. Usually, the other site would need to relate to this one in some way. It's been my experience if it doesn't relate, the ad will get shut (or shot) down. If you feel you have the artistry to create an ad for another site, post that up, too! We can critique the work and ensure most everyone likes the idea before posting it over. We really do want to put our best foot forward! There are some rules in making an image: The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI. Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur) Must be GIF or PNG No animated GIFs Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it. If you have some ideas and would like to discuss, you can also post ideas or questions a little more free form over on the site chat. If you like the idea, please let everyone know! How about Engineering.SE? 3D printers are pieces of engineering ingenuity, we sometimes receive questions that should be asked at the Engineering stack, I could imagine that there is a need for the other way around where people are interested in materializing their engineering question or solution. As I'm seriously lacking graphical design skills; I cannot really contribute to the actual design, but what may be interesting is to have a printed gear/sprocket morph into an actual gear/sprocket with the text \\\"How about materialize your idea\\\" or something with similar context. This could be something to start from: Makes some sense! What are you thinking for the ad itself? Any ideas? @P\u1d00\u1d1c\u029fs\u1d1b\u1d07\u02802 Updated the answer to include an idea for the banner. In the same vein, Electronics.SE is pretty much out sister side when it comes to wiring. @0scar - Anyway to fit something like that into a 600x500 pixel image? The ad could read something like: Imagine. Design. Slice. along the top, then 3DPrinting.SE along the bottom. Sounds like a great idea. StackOverflow is by for the most populated site (and the one I came from). 3D printing interests nerdy-trendy folks like those the in SO, that's where I can from. Prehaps woodworking SE sites would work as well. We can try this. However, when you advertise something which really is unrelated, the reality of it getting sponsored (getting six votes) becomes pretty slim. Woodworking would have a large crossover. Engineering too and maybe boardgame people.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.627255\\n\\n2019-02-01T21:11:38\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/384\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"0scar\\\", \\\"BanksySan\\\", \\\"P\u1d00\u1d1c\u029fs\u1d1b\u1d07\u02802\\\", \\\"Trish\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/11242\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/13813\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/5740\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/8884\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n329\\n\\nTag synonym: support & support-structures We have two tags: support & support-structures These two are essentially the same thing. Even the abbreviated tag-wikis are pretty much saying the same thing. IMHO, we should combine the two tags as they are superfluous. There was the Meta question: support-material / support-structures Tag unification? which was about combining support-material & support-structures which was turned down, but this request is quite different. I think we have to remove the \\\"support\\\" tag (support can have a different meaning), support-structures is more descriptive. The tags support & support-structures are in fact referring to exactly the same thing! Furthermore, the meaning of support can be interpreted differently (i.e. helping out). I support renaming/merging the support labelled questions to support-structures. This implies that the support tag is removed and it could be reinstated at any time by new questions. Users with enough reputation can remove the support tag if it gets recreated and we could create a synonym later. In my humble opinion, the best solution may be to rename support to supports and then make it a synonym for support-structures! Actually, you should have \\\"support\\\" point to \\\"support-structures\\\", if that is your intent? If you just rename one to the other without pointing it, the old tag can be recreated. As a mod, you can create the synonym directly without the voting hassle (it's hard to find five non-mod votes to push the synonym forward as they have to have \\\"so many\\\" points within the tag to vote on the synonym ... it's ridiculous). I did not think of it being re-created... We can anyways remove the support tag if it gets recreated or create a synonym later. I'm more in favor of renaming support to supports and then make it a synonym for support-structures. (I was thinking of a mod forced change, no voting) Yah, \\\"supports\\\" would work as well. I'm just thinking of removing the confusion up front. A little more work now creates a lot less work later, kind of thing. The thing I don't like about \\\"support\\\" as meaning someone coming on here to receive support ... isn't that what they come on here for help with in the first place? It seems like a superfluous kind of tag ... sort of \\\"self fulfilling\\\" or something, I don't know. It's like a tag named \\\"help\\\" ... lol. I'm sometimes surprised by the stuff the new users pull, but I'm always patient, and wouldn't be surprised to see the help or support tag appear... So we rename support to supports and create a synonym, the support structure will be the main tag. I've made a synonym - apparently it needs some votes. There's a problem with \\\"voting\\\" on the synonyms. You have to have enough tag votes in both to make the vote. I thought it made the synonym automagically for mods? Also, I would have thought it should be the other way, with \\\\[tag:support\\\\] being the main tag? (a) Yeah, I was surprised when it didn't just make it and required votes (maybe I am not all powerful after all?) for approval. (b) I thought support-structures should be the main as it matches support-material in format, and it is a more descriptive name (i.e., as hbp is the synonym of heated-bed) it seems to make more sense to do it that way around... I dunno, it can be swapped if you want. Actually, go to the synonym page and look at the list to the very right where it shows the vote count in parens. You should see an \\\"approve\\\" link there (I hope). That's what I just saw on two different synonyms on Mechanics.SE and was able to approve them outright. Yep, well spotted :-) Really, it should have just created it for you. Yeah, I might bug report that on SE.Meta\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.627866\\n\\n2018-09-03T21:49:01\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/329\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"0scar\\\", \\\"Box Box Box Box\\\", \\\"Greenonline\\\", \\\"P\u1d00\u1d1c\u029fs\u1d1b\u1d07\u02802\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/1039\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/11242\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4762\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/5740\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n423\\n\\n2019 Community Moderator Election Results 3D Printing's First Pro-Tem moderator election has come to a close, the votes have been tallied, and the new moderators is: They'll be joining the existing crew shortly \u2014 please thank them for volunteering, and share your assistance and advice with them as they learn the ropes!

Aside from reaching the requirement for >100 committers with >200 reputation, we are doing very well. Since our communities have a lot in common with all of the 3D printing I know takes place in the model aircraft and drone flying hobbies, I'm hoping to be able to convince some 3DPrinting.Meta users to commit to our proposal. As I mention in this Area51.Meta post: The problem arises from the fact that since this community is fairly different in scope and intended audience in comparison to most other existing SE sites, we have only been able to recruit a little less than half of the required supporters with >200 reputation across the Stack Exchange platform. Our Meta is tiny... Yeah it might be, but unfortunately @Trish, every little bit helps our case here... Area51 is unfortunately understaffed at this time. Basically, your question could be seen as an advertisement. So instead of focus on getting enough people to backup your proposal, you could go a little more in detail how 3DPrinting and Drones and Model Aircraft are not overlapping. This still gets your attraction while discussing overlap. E.g. design of servo mounts could be posted at your site, while printing issues with supports or filament specific questions fit better here.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.629070\\n\\n2020-01-18T22:17:09\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/472\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"0scar\\\", \\\"Trish\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/12377\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/5740\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/8884\\\", \\\"ifconfig\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n354\\n\\nSharing advice on how to print materials? I found this previous question about sharing settings and, while I agree that there are no 'best settings' because it depends on your printer, and sometimes the model being printed, I think we can still help people by posting some generic advice and indications for settings. I mean that if, in order to print Material X on my printer, I need to print at 30mm/s with a temperature of 220\u00b0C and an enclosure, it is highly unlikely than another printer can do it without the enclosure, at 80mm/s with a temperature of 190\u00b0C. (Those are completely random numbers.) Materials behave similarly no matter the printer, thus such advice might help people and draw some more people in as those Q&A would appear on Google searches. I think what would also bring people would be to do this for non-standard materials, ie not PLA or ABS, but stuff like wood and glow and carbon-fibers and so on. What do you think? These settings should be known from the inscription on the box or found on the internet (where you ordered the filament, or from the vendor's website) for that specific brand and type, I do not see why this should be maintained here. I strongly agree with Tom van der Zanden's answer that if people have problems, while following the ranges described by the vendor are used, do not lead to acceptable prints. To quote Tom, I have X printer, using Y settings, printing Z model in material W and I have V problem - how do I improve my settings? are valid questions, and What is the best profile for printing material X with printer Y? or (without the printer type) What is the best profile for printing material X? are not, and should indeed be voted to close due to \\\"Unclear what you're asking?\\\". You might wonder why the model makes such a difference. The difference is that instead of maintaining a database with settings for all material brands and or types, you now have a specific problem for a specific application that could be answered rather than having endless discussions over how people print a filament at which settings. It is the model that is sliced where the settings act upon, frequently this is where people make mistakes. Also, successfully extruding filament in the \\\"air\\\" does not guarantee success in printing, the difference is stressing or pressurising the filament path, hence a model should be included. Is there that much of a difference based on the model being printed? I've not seen any real difference based on model, but only depending on settings and filament being used.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.629487\\n\\n2018-10-19T11:19:51\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/354\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Sava\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/12917\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n467\\n\\nSo it looks like \\\\[tag:e3d-hermes\\\\] should be changed to \\\\[tag:e3d-hemera\\\\] Without going into the specifics (because I don't know them) E3D got into a bit of hot water with the name of their new Hermes extruder and determined that just renaming the extruder to Hemera would make life easier.

Yes it is possible to rename tags, but it would indeed be better to create a synonym as the extruder has had the Hermes name for a while.

I'm aware I cannot ask for recommendations and I'm not interested into. But I'm looking for a specific feature of a 3D printer and since my primary language is not English I'm not sure which is the correct word (or words) to describe such a feature. My question would be like this: \\\"I'm looking for an enclosed 3D printer that allows to load a common 1 kg filament bobbin. Do these bobbins rely on a specific standard? How to filter out the printers that match my request when making a Google search?\\\" Is this question acceptable for you? I think it's fine, with generic terms like that. In general, I don't think this sort of question would have the problems that come with recommendation-type questions. (Recommendation questions tend to be very subjective in terms of what the best product is, and also tend to be time-specific in that product availability/prices/etc. often changes over time.) That said, whether it'd be a good question and whether the community wants to allow such questions may be a different matter. Part identification is on topic We have had questions about what the specs for a motor were, we had some about replacement parts. Spool sizes are on topic Bobbins, reels or spools have almost standard sizes, because manufacturers buy them in bulk from China. Typical sizes I found looking on Alibaba (a website that connects manufacturers and wholesalers) are 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 3 kg, most feature the same outer diameter but different spool widths, which allows easier packing. If there is a standard for those would be totally on topic.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.631349\\n\\n2022-09-11T14:38:45\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/554\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Davo\\\", \\\"V2Blast\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/30940\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4922\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n591\\n\\nHow to share an stl file? I have a question about slicing. If I just describe the problem I would expect my question will be closed since the users have no way to reproduce the issue. Is there a way to share the stl file I'm using? Maybe share it on pastebin or github? We don't have a specific way to share a whole STL file. I've often thought that we could do with a sharing mechanism similar to that used on the Blender site, which is blender-exchange.com. See How to upload a blend file on BSE - good practices and advice for more info about that. I'm not sure how one would go about creating an \\\"stl-exchange\\\" though. However, see this comment and the following comment: I'd argue that 90-99% of uploaded files on Blend Exchange are a waste. They could either have been replaced with a couple of screenshots, a diagram, a short gif or a more accurate description. So, bearing that in mind, do you really need to share the whole STL file to illustrate the issue, or is there a Minimal Reproducible Example that you could use instead? Well, usually on other SE sites, when I post screenshots or don't upload a file they downvote or even close my question. And usually they don't like pastebin/github since they are temporary. I'm going to post the question. Hoping I don't deserve downvotes. Please note that screenshots of code or text are frowned upon, because images are not text-searchable. Temporary file storage is also not good, as once the link to the file is broken, then the question is probably useless without the file, and therefore useless to others.

A recent question was asked when the user said that they were creating a model to 3D print. But the body of the question was mostly about \\\"Crafting Perspex\\\".

That is why we have a voting system, if you think it is more appropriate at a different site, you can report this. If the initial report is filed, others may vote as well. Looking at the content of arts and crafts, I'm unsure if it is a fit. It should be a fit though. Alternatively, acrylic is also used in interior decorating (e.g. to make a window indoors), so a DIY SE would be a fit as well. Personally, since the question contains a 3D print part, a move did not make much sense at the time.

Looking through tags, I noticed that there are many different kinds of tags excerpt. A few examples: For questions about the Creality Ender 3 family of 3D printers Questions about the 3D printer firmware Marlin. when a logical or systematic search for the source of a problem in order to solve it is requested. helps to specify that the question is concerned with the material the print itself is made from. This includes 'filament' as a subgroup but also SL\u2026 should involve a 3D printer that is manufactured by Monoprice and branded by the name MP Select Mini 3D Printer v1/v2/pro. I wanted to add excerpt to another tag, but it looks like there is no template for it. Each tag is written differently and it looks a bit messy. In addition, in many cases, tag excerpt is too long. I have already read What should a tag wiki excerpt contain?, but I would also like to know what should be the template for a tag excerpt? I personally think that there should be no more than two sentences in a tag excerpt, and ideally if it contains one short sentence. Something like this is a good example: For questions about the Creality Ender 3 family of 3D printers. Tag excerpts should start with: For questions about... For questions related to... For questions regarding... Tag description is a separate matter, in which there should be a more detailed description. Good point about how to start the excerpt. It would be nice if they were all consistent. \\\"For questions about...\\\" is a good one. I'm sure that there is a meta question about this somewhere. I had a quick look earlier, but couldn't find the question that I was thinking about. Let know if you find it. It is a good question, and can be difficult to answer. It shouldn't be too long, as you have already noted, but it also should not just point out the obvious. That is to say, if the tag is filament, then the excerpt should definitely not just be: For questions about filament as it is not only obvious but also adds nothing that the name of the tag doesn't already provide. I would suggest that it would be better to put: For general questions about filament used for 3D Printing. For questions about specific filament types, see the tags pla, petg, ... <and list the tags1> Basically, if it is obviously what the tag refers to, then point out what the tag is not meant to be used for - in order to prevent its misuse... However, if the tag name is somewhat obscure then clearly it would be a good idea to spell out what it should be used for. Clearly, the line between obvious and not obvious could be a bit of a grey area, and not distinct, depending upon the tag. Footnotes 1 When listing related tags, make them active UI elements by using the appropriate markdown, like so: \\\\[tag:filament\\\\], \\\\[tag:PLA\\\\], \\\\[tag:PETG\\\\], etc. Good arguments. Simple excerpts are meaningless. Some info when to use this tag instead of others can also be useful. In your example, point 4. from question's link suits perfect and should be taken into consideration. Yes, quite. Your excerpt for stringing inspired me to post this answer. It seems a little bit obvious. However, off hand, I'm not quite sure what additional text would improve the excerpt..? Or even, if it needs improving. At least, your edit is better than it was, which was blank (I think, not sure). Anyway, thanks for looking into the tags, it is a job that needed doing :-)\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.632394\\n\\n2023-04-13T13:22:45\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/565\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Greenonline\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/27865\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4762\\\", \\\"kosteklvp\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n522\\n\\nBounty expired, and no answers -- now what? I put a bounty on this question, because the one answer it had seemed as if the answerer hadn't read the (admittedly long) question. The bounty just expired, and according to the message, I \\\"must award it to an answer within 24 hours.\\\" Only problem is, there are no answers (the one that was there when I raised the bounty has been deleted). I don't have an answer of my own to self-answer, the problem I asked about is still unsolved. How can I proceed in this case? Great question. I've had this happen when I put a bounty on somebody else's question. Sometimes there are just no answers, especially on very particular problems. :-( Note that the question itself is clear, the problem on the other hand is very difficult to grasp, I'm still inclined to put it in the category of a broken cable that sometimes loses connection or shorts as a result of the movement of the nozzle carriage, I've experienced that myself with a faulty BLTouch cable. That doesn't seem to stop people trying to answer (and even getting votes from similarly clueless readers) on other SE sites... I'll try to do an experiment early in a throw-away print -- I'll pull the extruder or z-axis stepper cable (those are fixed location and accessible while running) and see if that will stop the machine (effectively, simulating a broken wire disconnect). Occurred to me this morning that since this happens while printing infill (as opposed to walls) about 90% of the time, it might well be movement induced, but could also be the microSD socket losing connection. @ZeissIkon Indeed, bounties do attract attention, sometime the wrong kind... It is up to the community to vote the quality of the answer certainly when bounties are involved, you've seen that the deleted answer was such an answer but it got voted down. Hence voting is key, thank you for your contribution in that respect! @ZeissIkon Beware that pulling live stepper cables can destroy stepper drivers, be sure to read some info in that respect! Sigh. So much for the easy way. I already know (as a tool repair person) how annoying it is to try to trace an intermittent, and replacing the cables involves those woven wire looms... :( See SE.Meta; bounty expired with no answers\u2026 wasted reputation? Fortunately the Help Center helps out: How is a bounty awarded? The bounty period lasts 7 days. Bounties must have a minimum duration of at least 1 day. After the bounty ends, there is a grace period of 24 hours to manually award the bounty. Simply click the bounty award icon next to each answer to permanently award your bounty to the answerer. (You cannot award a bounty to your own answer.) If you do not award your bounty within 7 days (plus the grace period), the highest voted answer created after the bounty started with a minimum score of 2 will be awarded half the bounty amount (or the full amount, if the answer is also accepted). >If two or more eligible answers have the same score (their scores are tied), the oldest answer is chosen. If there's no answer meeting those criteria, no bounty is awarded to anyone. If the bounty was started by the question owner, and the question owner accepts an answer posted during the bounty period, and the bounty expires without an explicit award then we assume the bounty owner liked the answer they accepted and award it the full bounty amount at the time of bounty expiration. As a special bonus, any reputation you earn from being awarded a bounty is exempt from the daily reputation cap. There has to be answer to award the bounty, in this particular case there aren't any answers, so no bounty can be rewarded. The messages you receive are the standard messages. You cannot select an answer, nor can the system. If the deleted answer hadn't been deleted, the negative score would have prevented from being selected by the system as it needs a 2+ vote for automatic rewarding. Basically, you cannot do anything. You could consider removing (deleting) the question, this is a very particular / intermittent failure that is very difficult to troubleshoot. You might find the solution yourself one day! I think I'm better leaving the question -- at least someone else with the same problem will know to call an exorcist first. Will the system put up a message saying the bounty wasn't awarded, leave the bounty banner up, or just remove it entirely (along with my 50 rep)? @ZeissIkon Unfortunately, bounties are non-refundable and immediately deduced from your reputation stack. I hope you once find the solution and post it yourself. The banner will be gone after the grace period has ended. k. If I find a solution, you may rest assured I'll post it. The solution is, if you don't award the points, the points go away and nobody gets them. There is nothing stating you have to award the points. If there's nothing you can award the points to, then that's that. This is how the system works.

In addition to this: Is photogrammetry and 3D scanning on-topic? Shouldn't this site be called \\\"3D manufacturing\\\" or something broader? As 3D printing suggest only \\\"printing\\\" and not everything related to 3D printing such as 3D scanning or even 3D designing. I suppose that is off-topic? Is this scope defined somewhere? Is everything related to (or for the purpose of) 3D printing such as 3D scanning using photogrammetry, NeRF or other techniques as well as 3D designing in-scope on this site? I think both 3D scanning as well as 3D designing should be on-topic here. This was originally a 3D Printing site, and it still is. However, then when certain questions were asked, that weren't about 3D printing (but which also didn't fit on any other site, i.e. Engineering), but were about similarly related topics (i.e. CNC, or cartesian laser etching machines), where (the particular aspects of) the technology that was asked about was essentially the same, it didn't make that much sense not to answer them, and so they became allowed, and so on - yes, there was (and sometimes still is) some mission creep. All of this was covered by (amongst others) these three \\\"umbrella\\\" posts (in the following order): Game plan - What is on-topic? On-topic has been updated - finally! On-topic page is finally finished (again...) So, the on-topic debate was finally (?) settled. Yes, the on-topic subjects are maybe wider that the original \\\"3D Printing site\\\" concept. However, IMHO, changing the name at this late stage might be a bit drastic (possibly during beta stage is the latest opportunity for a name change?)... plus, the majority of the questions that hit the site are still predominately about 3D printing, as the first line of the on-topic page states: Please make sure that your questions are intrinsically 3D printing oriented. 3D scanning and 3D design are on-topic here, so long as the end result is (stated to be) a 3D printed model. It should also be noted that 3D scanning is explicitly listed in the on-topic page. If you would like to suggest a broader scoped \\\"Manufacturing\\\" site for Stack Exchange, then Area 51 is the place to go. There was a Digital Fabrication site and a Personal Manufacturing site but both of these apparently failed to get out of Beta. This site (with a narrower remit) took a long time to get out of Beta (see What does it take to get out of Beta stage?), and which was thankfully achieved, see We're graduating!, due to the community successfully keeping the site centered around a 3D printing ethos. That sounds great and then I saw this Stack site https://blender.stackexchange.com/. What an overlap. I really think that for those communities should merge to create one big \\\"3D\\\" site (manufacture or \\\"print\\\", scan, design). This site doesn't seem to have many active users IMHO.

I'm dissapointed in the size of the active community on this site, considering how long the site has been active (https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing) and how mainstream 3D printing is. It's visible on the amount of views and votes that questions get, and the lack of answers on many questions. As well as a handful of users that are usually involved. It's unfortunate, I for example really like the (also relatively small) Information Security Stack site which is much more active. I thought of ways to get people to even know about the existance of this site: Posting links to this site on other sites such as when posting a make, or object on Thingiverse and Printables Using it more commonly in YouTube comments or other comments to link to answers or questions that are applicable in the context Question Migration from more popular sites such as StackOverflow, below are some examples of search queries that result in many (not all) questions that belong to this site instead: https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=3d+printing https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=3d+print https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=stl+obj https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=ender+3 https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=klipper https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=gcode https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=creality https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=octoprint https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=prusa https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=cura+slicer https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=marlin https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=bed+leveling https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=pla+filament https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=print+filament https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=thingiverse https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=grabcad I think migration (also from other sites) is perhaps the most effective for multiple reasons. As I believe the user is notified, also more relevant content is available on this site making it easier found when using search engines. What are your thoughts on this, why isn't this community bigger and more active, did it used to be, what was already tried? Also, not enough up and downvoting decreases the quality of this site a lot, since it's much harder to distinguish good quality from lower quality content. I've just remembered that we have a Public 3D Printing chatroom. It might be worth popping in there to discuss some of your meta points with some other members. TL;DR Similar concerns about the size of the community have been raised for many years, as the links below show. Migration General It is worth remembering that migration only has a rather small window (of a few days or so) after which a question is deemed \\\"too old to migrate\\\" and the option just greyed out (or unavailable, I forget which now)... annoying I know, but those are the rules. IMHO, migration is pointless (and can require \\\"back-channel\\\" communication and agreements between sites) and just not worth the bother. Generally, it is much more simpler and efficient (and rapid) to just ask the poster to delete their question on the first site and just re-post it themselves on the new site. A very similar question was asked recently on the Robotics Meta, please read Can/should questions on Stack Overflow about ROS be migrated here?. The answer seems to also apply to this site and (more or less) re-iterates what I said above. Also, this answer to Is \\\"Too old to migrate\\\" a good reason NOT to migrate? is really useful. Other sites I looked at some of the G-code questions on SO and a number of them are related to simply programmatic issues, parsing issues or substitution, that don't have a 3D Printing end-game, and so they wouldn't be on-topic anyway. The Robotics site was in a real lull until quite recently, when the ROS (Q&A) community was merged. In the past some 3D printing questions were posted there, and I did think about getting those migrated, but then the OP had a meltdown and rage-quit, so that was the end of that. The Engineering site also has some 3D design/modelling questions that could have fitted here, but (as has been stated elsewhere) it is OK for some overlap to exist between SE sites, a question might be suited to more than one site and it doesn't really matter where it lands - the question just gets slightly re-jigged for the appropriate audience. Traffic There are graphs and spreadsheets and databases that can be queried to give you this sort of info. Early numbers can be seen in this (now rather ramshackle) answer to What does it take to get out of Beta stage?. Also (vaguely) related are questions discussing participation: New users aren't posting their own questions - are we scaring them off? more to be added as they are found... A subjective view I have had the (possibly unjustified) feeling that the site has tailed off since early 2022 or so (as I noted at the end of this answer to Is 3dprinting.stackexchange.com likely to still be active in the foreseeable future?). My overall impression is that this site was vibrant and had at least 10+ permanently active users, seven years ago, back in 2016. The questions back then seemed to be more related to: building DIY printers; fixing Prusa printers and their clones; filament queries; general Arduino questions, and; firmware issues. However, 3D printing has become much more mainstream, in the past few years, there are many more reliable manufacturers of printers that (apparently) just \\\"work out of the box\\\" and less people are building from scratch. So, less questions... apart from the initial flurry of Creality support questions1, when these printers first started to become popular (4-5 years ago?). Nevertheless, even these types of questions seem to have tailed off, now, after a subsequent flurry of questions about Creality add-ons, such as the BLTouch (et al). Also, w.r.t. repair, as 0scar states, most of the tinkering and repairing questions have already been asked and answered, back in the days of DIY printers. However, now and again a good old-fashioned board repair question comes along that you can get your teeth into, but they are becoming increasingly infrequent. Nowadays, we seem to be down to a core of 4 or 5 regular visitors and a few other less-regular users. Chat room I've just remembered that we also have a vibrant chat room (two in fact, see Do we have a chatroom?), which were active in 2018 onwards, and (after having just checked) the Public 3D Printing chatroom still is. Promotion There was the opportunity to advertise our site, using community ads, but I'm not sure what ever came of that. See: Community Ads! Let's make 2d ads for ourselves! Which SE sites should we target with community ads? Advertising on other SE sites: 2019 Version Also, this question has (sort of) been asked before, How do we get more traffic to the site? Voting You do raise a good point: No votes makes it hard to sort the wheat from the chaff. Again, the voting (or apparent lack thereof) has been raised in the past, see: How do we motivate users to vote and advertise the voting policy? Vote early, Vote often Remember to vote! Although, all of these seem to be from 2016. I really thought that there were a couple more recently asked questions... but maybe there aren't. Footnote 1 See the tail end of this answer and this comment The problem is that there are more volatile other media then there used to be, e.g. Reddit, but the quality of the answers there is generally disappointing. There is so much more information, video channels and fora to be found that each has their own dedicated group of users. SE tries to aim for high quality (community) moderator driven question and answer sites, this just doesn't addresses everybody, sometimes people want to go into endless discussions for which SE is not the platform. The analytics page (visible for 5000 rep users, but a history is maintained fro a while in What does it take to get out of Beta stage?) shows that the site gets frequently hit, many first timers that are drawn here through search engine queries. Do note that 3D printing is in effect a pretty simple process, like an internal combustion engine needs air, fuel and a spark, a 3D printer needs a location, filament heating and preprocessed file; after a while most questions are asked. Appearently, the users find their answers in the existing questions. New techniques and advances in firmware and software trigger new questions like recently we receive more Klipper, input shaping and Resin related print questions. Migration \\\"from and to\\\" other sites does happen but not frequent. The provided links do show many topics related to 3D printing, but looking at the questions, the vast majority does not belong here according to our \\\"What topics can I ask about here?\\\". I appreciate your answer. I personally disagree to the 'after a while most questions are asked', out of a personal urge to keep innovating. But you're probably right for the average user. However, it doesn't address my specific question about the strategy of migrating content from other sites. What's your view on that? Considering the overwhelming flood of cheap 3D printers in the market and the inexperienced user base the most questions are asked already, many new ones are related or in the troubleshooting category. Hence my referring to the new software/firmware options that may spark new questions. Migration is not necessary for most of the questions in the link (caveat, I haven't looked at all the links you provided). But if a question might be better suitable here you could raise the migration flag on any question you encounter, moderators will view your request and decide if migration is justified. As one of the Quintarchy of users that managed to get more than 10000 Rep here, and someone that was very active like 2 years ago I can tell you a tale that might exemplarify why migration can help, but doesn't happen a lot: A tale of 3 Printers My tale of 3D printing began with a silly question about perfect 3D printed dice. Which, actually didn't star here: it was migrated from RPG.SE over here. It made me aware of the place. I made that question back then way before I had my own printer, but after a couple of material science classes that discussed pretty much the contents of the answer to the question and I tried to apply it to a hobby. It brought me to another hobby I would soon pick up: About christmas I bought my first printer, a TronXY X1. It was cheap, it was a tinker machine with a crazy wobbly gantry out of the box and I re-engineered a gantry slider for it that turned out to act like a spring on itself and keep the gantry with a little load and thus straight. It was a project in itself. In July 2018 I finally took my step to buy an Ender 3. The version 1, but not the very first production run. I started to look up trying to get an inductive probe running, so I figured out voltage first, then a setup, and came to a hiccup: I needed to update Firmware. That firmware update sent me down the drain: I had never worked with firmware before, and half the answers were very cryptic to me as a beginner. But I sat down with Greenonline in chat and we went on a deep dive into what actually was the board in the machine I bought, and how to actually install firmware on it. It was a crazy few days for me, and I learned more between the bouts of feeling overwhelmed and seeing some success and waiting for an arduino to actually flash the firmware! It led to a flurry of questions: starting by recalibrating, trying to install hex firmware, making my own hex file for a modified firmware, and flashing the board before going full circle. Many of these questions would not be amiss on Adruino or Stack Overflow, but their context was always dealing with my printer. The Ender3 had just about as hefty a learning curve as dealing with the mechanical wobble of the TronXY X1 at first. But I had this community (and chat) as my support. Why was the learnign curve so hefty? Well, the initial V1 was not good. It was cheap, it had problems. Like the Z-endstop is from the factory misaligned, I ruinied about 5 or such glue on surfaces, Thermal Runaway PRotection wasn't flashed by default, the extriuder lever breaking could not be seen easily, leading me down to esoteric questions that to me now read like \\\"Why the F... is my Layer height wrong?\\\" and only some week after I noticed the break and got an aluminium replacement, firmware needed another upgrade to turn on Power Loss recovery after the TRP upgrade did lack it (though it never saw use - crazy stable power net here)... I even started the Knowledgebase tag to make some of the most common-appearing questions easily findable. A Hotend swap required a PID Tune (which I only documented about a year later!)... And then my Ender3 v1 broke as I moved it. The extruder stepper driver just fizzled. So I bought an Ender3 V2, put it together but out of the box swapped the extruder for the aluminium one, and... I kind of realized that I had no more questions that I either hadn't learned or asked about previously and that the Ender3 V2 was out of the box and much more user-friendly. It just... worked. Sure, it does not come with mesh bed leveling, its firmware isn't perfect, but it just worked. 3D printing had changed so much over the years since I started as a 3rd generation hobbyist (as in: 1st Gen was Reprap, 2nd gen was parts kits, 3rd gen is early (ca pre-2019) printers and now... we are way deep in Gen 4 or 5 printers that actively build on the problems of their predecessors. The tech is much more mature, and I am much more knowledgeable. migration issue Now, my tale began with one migration. But that is an exception. We got a couple questions that were really ill fits. I helped to establish the benchmark test: \\\"Does the question claim that it's for 3D printing?\\\". But often the questions have no clear target. There's Blender, but most often that didn't fit. There's engineering, but often the question was not about either. In fact, most questions did not fit any stack we knew about. Thank you for sharing. I appreciate it. I have a software background, less so hardware. It is one of the reasons why I got into 3D printing. I started with a Ender 3 V2, I realize it has evolved a lot already but both cheaper or much better printers are available, I can buy a expensive machine but I rather buy a cheaper model and learn to upgrade it and understand the fundamentals of it. The knowledge gained from that is much more valuable to me than the actual printer is. I still think even with the currently best printers we can still find many things to improve and so, knowledge to share.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.634787\\n\\n2023-11-22T15:41:13\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/582\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"0scar\\\", \\\"Bob Ortiz\\\", \\\"Greenonline\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/36802\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4762\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/5740\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n580\\n\\nMerge input-shaping, resonance-compensation and vibration-compensation tags as synonyms I don't have the needed reputation on this site yet and I didn't seen another option to suggest this, so I'm suggesting it here. Please make the following tags one, as synonyms: input-shaping (the Marlin term) resonance-compensation (the Klipper term) vibration-compensation (the BambuLab term) They all describe the same concept to my understanding. Seen that all three tags are all used on three questions (not separately) a single tag would have been more than enough. input-shaping would be sufficient. If others would be using other tags, we could then decide to merge the tags for synonyms. Those questions are all mine. I'm fine to use only the input-shaping tag, but as those three things are synonyms. To reduce potential duplicates and to increase seo, I recommend already setting them up as synonyms. As each sub-community might use their own term for the same concept, making it very confusing if the subject is unfamiliar to the user.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.637744\\n\\n2023-11-21T13:08:04\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/580\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Bob Ortiz\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/36802\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n585\\n\\nWhat is wrong with these suggested edits and why are they rejected? I'm reviewing my recent suggested edits and don't understand why these five are rejected because: The edit does not improve the quality of the post. Changes to the content are unnecessary or make the post more confusing https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/17526 https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/17532 https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/17437 https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/17435 https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/17434 None of the above examples contained a question in the title, and without reading anything else, one could not tell what the questioner would possibly try to ask or achieve. Each suggested edit clarifies the question's primary purpose a lot, making it an improvement and certainly not more confusing, for readers simply scrolling through the homepage and looking at the titles. What can be improved to avoid future useless edits, which is a waste of time? Image sizes One thing that I have noticed is that you change the URL of an image (taking this suggested edit as an example), from: \\\\[1\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/SoOVE.jpg to \\\\[1\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/SoOVEm.jpg However, if you do that, then, when you click on the image, to view the high resolution image, you are presented with an inferior lower-res image. Try clicking this image below: Now, if you click this image, you will get a superior image and better detail (which is always useful): Also, the top image seems a bit too small in the overall scheme of the post, IMHO. However, if you like that \\\"smallness\\\" but still want to be able to click to a higher resolution image then you'd have to reference two image URLs, one for each size, something like this: \\\\[!\\\\[Extruder\\\\]\\\\[1\\\\]\\\\]\\\\[2\\\\] ... \\\\[1\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/SoOVEm.jpg \\\"Extruder\\\" \\\\[2\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/SoOVE.jpg This seems a bit too convoluted for my liking though, and might get messed up when other URLs (links and images) are added by the editor - not sure, not tested it. It would be good if it did get handled correctly though. Adding image hover tags One other thing, after the image URL, if you repeat the image description in quotes, like this: \\\\[!\\\\[This is a hi res image\\\\]\\\\[3\\\\]\\\\]\\\\[3\\\\] ... \\\\[3\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/SoOVE.jpg \\\"This is a hi res image\\\" when you hover the mouse cursor over the image, the usually invisible (and seemingly pointless) image description now shows up in a \\\"hover tag/label\\\". Try it with the two images above. This gives new rhyme and reason for adding meaningful description image descriptions, i.e. \\\\[!\\\\[Extruder\\\\]\\\\[1\\\\]\\\\]\\\\[1\\\\] \\\\[!\\\\[Knurled drive gear\\\\]\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\]\\\\[2\\\\] ... \\\\[1\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/SoOVE.jpg \\\"Extruder\\\" \\\\[2\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/zFo8A.png \\\"Knurled drive gear\\\" rather than \\\\[!\\\\[photo 1 of hotend\\\\]\\\\[1\\\\]\\\\]\\\\[1\\\\] \\\\[!\\\\[photo 2 of hotend\\\\]\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\]\\\\[2\\\\] ... \\\\[1\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/SoOVEm.jpg \\\\[2\\\\]: https://i.sstatic.net/zFo8Am.png especially as neither of the photos are of a hotend, per se. :-) The editing in of \\\"image hover tags\\\" is mentioned in Useful things to check for when cleaning up posts but not (as I have just realised) actually explained..! I'll add the examples above to that post somewhere, so thanks for bringing that to fore. Spaces and SI units Also, please see Don't forget the space!. The space between \\\"1.75\\\" and \\\"mm\\\" should not be removed. However, it should (or could) be replaced with a &nbsp; (non-breaking space). Thank you for the detailed write-up. Thats OK, I needed to make an example of implementing image hover tags anyway. I am hopefully just trying to clear any issues up that you might have. As I've said before, thanks for helping out around the site. I do very little \\\"site activity\\\" now, just mod stuff and review queues. Rarely have time to actually answer questions these days unfortunately. The same goes for some other members too, I think - job changes, less free time, etc.. :-) I can't speak for the other reviewers of your suggested edits, but... Possibly, at first glance at your links, I would avoid just changing the title into a question (from an already grammatically correct statement) on an old established question - as this adds little to the post and just bumps the question (again). From your examples: #1, #2, #4 and #5 just seem to change a couple of words, but with little (or no) added value - apart from making a grammatical question, which isn't really strictly necessary. Many sites use title statements rather than questions - to be honest, either seem acceptable, so just changing titles (of old questions) into grammatically correct interrogations seems unnecessary. You could do that for the new posts, as they aren't yet established - but if you are trying to look up an older question and the title has been changed, then that could be taken as \\\"making the post more confusing\\\". Also, there are a lot of question titles that aren't questions (but statements instead), and converting them all would mean a lot of suggested edit reviews - all for little to no gain. Focusing on #5 for a moment, adding the \\\"Longer LK5 Pro\\\" to the title is redundant as the question is already tagged with longer-lk5. Generally, when a question is tagged with \\\"something\\\", that \\\"something\\\" is then removed from the title due to redundancy (see the section Avoid putting tags in the question title under this answer to How do I make a good edit?). That said, your example #3 does seem useful as it does (admittedly) describe the issue better. That was one that I rejected, purely because (IIRC) it is an old question that already has an answer (that probably should have been accepted, had the user returned to the site after posting the question). Actually, sticking with #3, the \\\"with TMC2208 and Klipper\\\" in the title should be removed as it is redundant, due to the tags (going by what was said above), which (by those rules) would leave the title as just: Creality Sprite Extruder custom install on Ender 3 Pro which really is utterly meaningless! LOL. :-) So, maybe the part of your suggested edit that includes the voltage is a very good idea - even though the answer then states that the voltages should be ignored - so something like this: How to configure the TMC2208 Driver Voltage for a Creality Sprite Extruder custom install and maybe tag with ender-3-pro, if there is one, otherwise the existing ender-3 tag might suffice..? However, I'm not sure how the Ender printers are meant to be tagged, and I might be wrong. There was a Meta post/discussion somewhere by Trish and/or 0scar about a possible hierarchy of tags, i.e. something like creality andender and then 3, which I think was rejected - however, I've had a good look and really can't find the meta post. So, in summary, I would reject all of those edits again, apart from #3 as the title is a bit of a mess anyway - remove the redundant already tagged info from the title and mention the stepper driver voltages. If you suggest that edit, I'll accept it :-) Suggestions As this is a small site (with little traffic, as discussed in your previous meta post), most of the questions have been edited to death already and as such, it can be difficult to find things to fix. It is probably best to stick to new posts that haven't yet been edited, or if an older post is blatantly incorrect and has been missed then that should be fixed. You might find this useful: Useful things to check for when cleaning up posts I notice that you've added some tags in other suggested edits. Many of these tags have no description, which can make it a bit harder to review the suggested edit, w.r.t the validity of the tag. If you could edit such \\\"empty\\\" tags, with descriptions and usage, that would be really useful. In which case, these are related: Do we have a template for a tag excerpt? Circular tag wiki excerpts The problem with mods doing reviews As there really are so few regular users on the site, the review queues often fall to the moderators - otherwise they would never be cleared. One issue with mods undertaking reviews, is that we are unable to vote as normal users, see Add a way for moderators to cast a normal, non binding close/open vote. That means that only one vote of ours is needed, which seems very undemocratic. I'm not happy about this, and would much prefer to have a community of votes, as is the usual case. Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury, and so some votes may seem autocratic in nature. However, as you have done, bringing up any perceived slight is always a good idea, and raising them here in Meta is always good for a discussion. Can you still re-approve #3? There is nothing in that review queue currently, so I can't review it again, as there is nothing to review. Previously reviewed posts can not be re-reviewed, there is no such option, even for mods, unfortunately. I've resubmitted the edit.\\n\\nStack Exchange\\n\\n2025-03-21T12:54:35.638048\\n\\n2023-11-27T13:11:16\\n\\n{ \\\"license\\\": \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\", \\\"site\\\": \\\"3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/585\\\", \\\"authors\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Bob Ortiz\\\", \\\"Greenonline\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/36802\\\", \\\"https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4762\\\" \\\\], \\\"all\\\\_licenses\\\": \\\\[ \\\"Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" \\\\], \\\"sort\\\": \\\"votes\\\", \\\"include\\\\_comments\\\": true }\\n\\n388\\n\\nWhat do we consider Simple/Advanced/Complicated things to fix on a machine and how to tell the asker? I think we all had this issue in the last years: As we learn and grow our own knowledge, things we once considered hard become easy. Now, our answers often address issues that are pretty easy to fix by tweaking simple things like... leveling the bed fixing the settings in the slicer replacing a broken endstop for a new part correct replacement nozzle pretty 2/3rd of the questions in troubleshooting At other times, we clearly go into advanced repairs and fixes, for example: flashing firmware small alterations of the firmware installing new capabilities to a printer most of the remaining 1/3rd of troubleshooting, usually for the points above And then there are at times rather complicated things, for example: sifting through the firmware to find when one function is actually called the remaining troubleshooting turns out the be this, because of the oddity of the problem. Call Let us make a rough guideline what rough level of expertise we expect from a common user and how to address the required level of details in answers! Wouldn't that still be \\\"primarily opinion based\\\" and depending on the level of expertise of the tinkerer? ;) I like the points raised in this question as well as the ordering/organisation of the fixes/tasks, but it would really depend on the user and where they are coming from (as @0scar says \\\"the level of expertise of the tinkerer\\\"). As a case in point, (as well as playing devil's advocate) seeing as I still (rather embarrassingly) haven't got around to actually finish building any physical printer, but I have extensively rummaged around in the various firmware out there (as well as coming from an programming/Arduino background), currently I'd, rather ironically, find the advanced and complicated fixes easier to do than the simple things that you listed. However, I know that I'm not representative of the average just-bought-a-printer-and-now-have-a-problem type user and for those users, your list and ordering probably makes much more sense. The ordering would also be equally valid for a printer-builder user, as they are for a straight-out-of-the-box user, I guess. However, I don't know if we can expect any user of the site to have any particular certain level of expertise. I guess that can only be ascertained by the reading of their question and how they answer any follow up questions that might get raised, in the comments.

I used high-quality Hugging Face links for each available component (C4, Wikipedia, Gutenberg, BookCorpusOpen, arXiv). For GitHub, I used the widely used HF GitHub code dataset (1 TB).\n- Where exact HF datasets for certain sources (e.g., CCNet English, full StackExchange) are not cleanly available with clear GB sizes, I prioritized the closest HF-hosted equivalents with clear sizes to meet the sheet\u2019s numeric requirement.\n\nYou can access the updated sheet here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mXXFbhOndcGJfeeyUhFTaXMFIA9bbuVq4t2-luU3dl8/edit#gid=0"
