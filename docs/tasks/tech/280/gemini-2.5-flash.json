The first step is to prepare pre-training data, so I need your help organizing the pre-training data for llama and gpt-neo into the `ptdata` sheet in `LLM Pre-training Data` spreadsheet. The pre-training data should be sorted in descending order by data size, with columns named `name`, `use in llm` (the value should only include llama and gpt-neo; if used by both models, it should be either gpt-neo or llama), `size` (the numeric value in GB, but do not include \"GB\" in cell), and `link` in order. The link to huggingface is preferred; if huggingface doesn't have the dataset, we'll try to provide other links."

In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.

For LLaMA, I will list commonly used large datasets, and try to find their sizes and Hugging Face links. I will prioritize datasets mentioned in discussions about LLaMA's training data, even if I can't find a direct statement in an \"official\" summary. I will make a reasonable estimate for the size if an exact number is not immediately available, and indicate that it's an estimate.\n\nI will attempt to use `web_search` one more time for \"Hugging Face The Pile dataset\" and \"Hugging Face CommonCrawl C4 dataset\" to get the most accurate links and sizes.
