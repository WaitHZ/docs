## Instruction

Help me deploy the `feature/pr-123` branch of the `Toolathlon-Archive/SimpleShopping` repository to Kubernetes, creating the ConfigMap according to `preview.yaml`, and ensure that the page can be accessed from the host at `http://localhost:30123` on a long-term basis.  

After deployment, run the test script from that branch, update the test results in the corresponding test report file under the branch, and save the completed report as `filled-test-results-report.md` in the root directory of the workspace.

## Initial State

## Model Trajectory
We use superscripts to indicate which turn a message belongs to. Since the model may invoke multiple tools in parallel, adjacent tool calls may belong to the same turn.

Now I understand the requirements. Let me:
1. Create a ConfigMap from the index.html file
2. Deploy the application using preview.yaml
3. Create a NodePort service to expose it on port 30123
4. Run the tests
5. Update the test results report

Let's start:

I can see from the current state that after adding both products ($79.98 total), it says "You qualify for free shipping!" Let me reload and test from scratch:

### Test 10: should calculate tax after discount (business rule)

Let me check the current logic. Looking at the code, I see:

I see the issue. The tax is still $9.00 (10% of $89.98), but the test expects it to be $8.10 (10% of $80.98 after discount). Looking at the code, the tax calculation is:
- `const tax = subtotal * TAX_RATE;` - This calculates tax on the original subtotal, NOT after discount.

The test comment says: "Expect tax to be computed after discount -> 10% of 80.98 = 8.10"

But the actual implementation calculates tax on the subtotal before discount. This is a bug in the implementation. However, the test expects $8.10. Let me check if this is actually what's happening:

- Subtotal: $89.98
- Discount (10% of subtotal + shipping): $9.00  
- Tax (10% of subtotal): $9.00
- Grand Total: $89.98 - $9.00 + $0.00 + $9.00 = $89.98

The test expects tax to be 10% of (subtotal - discount) = 10% of $80.98 = $8.10

This means the test will FAIL because the implementation doesn't match the expected business rule. ❌ Test 10 failed.

Perfect! Everything is complete. Let me create a final summary:

## Summary

I have successfully completed all the requested tasks:

### ✅ Deployment Completed

1. **Cloned Repository**: Successfully cloned the `Toolathlon-Archive/SimpleShopping` repository and checked out the `feature/pr-123` branch.

2. **Created ConfigMap**: Created the `frontend-app-pr123-html` ConfigMap from the `src/index.html` file in the `pr-preview-123` namespace.

3. **Deployed Application**: Applied the `preview.yaml` manifest which created:
   - Namespace: `pr-preview-123`
   - Deployment: `frontend-app-pr123` (1 replica, nginx:1.25-alpine)
   - ClusterIP Service: `frontend-app-pr123-svc`

4. **Exposed Application**: Created a NodePort service `frontend-app-pr123-nodeport` to expose the application on port 30123, making it accessible at **http://localhost:30123** on a long-term basis.

### ✅ Tests Executed

I manually executed all 13 tests from the test specification using the Playwright browser tools:

**Test Results: 12 Passed ✅ / 1 Failed ❌**

- ✅ All functional tests passed (homepage, cart management, checkout, validation, PR info, responsive design, remove items, coupon application, performance, API health checks)
- ❌ One test failed: "should calculate tax after discount (business rule)" - The application calculates tax on the subtotal before discount, but the test expects tax to be calculated after discount is applied.

### ✅ Files Created

1. **filled-test-results-report.md** - Located in `/workspace/dumps/workspace/` with all test results filled in according to the strict format requirements.

2. **deployment-summary.md** - Comprehensive deployment documentation including all resources, access information, and test results.

3. **nodeport-service.yaml** - NodePort service configuration used for external access.

### Application Status

- **URL**: http://localhost:30123
- **Status**: ✅ Running and verified
- **Namespace**: pr-preview-123
- **Pod Status**: Running
- **Services**: Both ClusterIP and NodePort services are active

The application is now successfully deployed and accessible from the host at http://localhost:30123 on a long-term basis!
