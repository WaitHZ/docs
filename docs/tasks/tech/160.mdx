## Instruction

Hello! I am a PhD student engaged in deep learning research. Recently, my collaborators and I have proposed a logical reasoning dataset and are writing a paper to introduce this new dataset to the community. To demonstrate the differences between our work and previous work, I need you to help me summarize a latex table and save it in the workspace with name as `datasets.tex`, the tex file should only contain table content (no commented lines), without any other content. The table needs to include four columns: Dataset (dataset name), Tasks (number of tasks included in the dataset), Trainable (whether it includes a training set, filled with \ding\{55\} or \ding\{51\}), and Adjustable Difficulty (whether it includes different difficulty levels, filled with \ding\{55\} or \ding\{51\}). The table format is as follows:

```tex
\begin\{table\}[!ht]
    \begin\{center\}
    \begin\{tabular\}\{lccc\}
        \toprule
        Dataset & Tasks & Trainable & Adjustable Difficulty\\
        \midrule
        % content
        \bottomrule
    \end\{tabular\}
  \end\{center\}
\end\{table\}
```

The names of the datasets we need to include are (from top to bottom):
- BBH
- Zebra Logic
- KOR-Bench (# of tasks should based the broader categorization in the paper.)
- K&K (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123)
- BBEH

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n($6.8\\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with\nreinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external\nenvironments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that\nrequire multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing\napproaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at\nthe final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in\nmulti-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:\n(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and\nprovide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit\nassignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in\nlong-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each\ninteraction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the\nground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the\npolicy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior\nprocess-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly\nMonte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the\nmodel's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined\nwith outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive\nexperiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that\nIGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,\nachieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.",

Our training data consists of\nclose-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from\nmotion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,\nPonimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that\nuses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive\nposes, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize\ninteractive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are\nunavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including\nimage-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction\nsynthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality\nmocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse\ndatasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and\nthe effectiveness and robustness of our framework.",

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n($6.8\\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.",

> Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate and memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop reasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis based on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles. Our code and data are available at [this https URL](https://memkklogic.github.io).

> Abstract:In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning (KOR), a concept aimed at minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge, enabling more accurate evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in out-of-distribution settings. Based on this concept, we propose the Knowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning Benchmark (KOR-Bench), encompassing five task categories: Operation, Logic, Cipher, Puzzle, and Counterfactual. KOR-Bench emphasizes models' effectiveness in applying new rule descriptions to solve novel rule-driven questions. O1-Preview and O1-Mini achieve accuracies of 72.88% and 70.16%, surpassing Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o (58.96% and 58.00%), highlighting the effectiveness of KOR-Bench. We perform detailed analyses, identifying bottlenecks in the Cipher task with Stepwise Prompting, where two rounds of Self-Correction yield optimal results. We evaluate performance across three integrated tasks, explore the impact of Tricks on the Puzzle task, and visualize rule-focused attention. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on dataset size, benchmark correlations, and zero-shot and three-shot "only questions" experiments. KOR-Bench aims to enhance reasoning evaluation and support further research in this area.

However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks predominantly focus on mathematical and coding abilities, leaving a gap in evaluating broader reasoning proficiencies. One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average accuracy of 9.8\\% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8\\% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh" rel="external

logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty. <br>Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement. </blockquote> <!--CONTEXT--> <div

ABSTRACT
In this paper, we introduce K NOWLEDGE -ORTHOGONAL REASONING (KOR),
a concept aimed at minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge, enabling
more accurate evaluation of models‚Äô reasoning abilities in out-of-distribution set-
tings. Based on this concept, we propose the K NOWLEDGE -ORTHOGONAL REA-
SONING BENCHMARK (KOR-B ENCH ), encompassing five task categories: Op-
eration, Logic, Cipher, Puzzle, and Counterfactual. KOR-Bench emphasizes mod-
els‚Äô effectiveness in applying new rule descriptions to solve novel rule-driven
questions. O1-Preview and O1-Mini achieve accuracies of 72.88% and 70.16%,
surpassing Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o (58.96% and 58.00%), highlighting
the effectiveness of KOR-Bench. We perform detailed analyses, identifying bot-
tlenecks in the Cipher task with Stepwise Prompting, where two rounds of Self-
Correction yield optimal results. We evaluate performance across three integrated
tasks, explore the impact of Tricks on the Puzzle task, and visualize rule-focused
attention. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on dataset size, benchmark
correlations, and zero-shot and three-shot "only questions" experiments. KOR-
Bench aims to enhance reasoning evaluation and support further research in this
area.

Figure 1: Overview of KOR-Bench.Reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human
intelligence, and research indicates that when
models reach a sufficient scale, they exhibit
emergent behaviors‚Äîincluding advanced rea-
soning capabilities such as understanding com-
plex scenarios, strategic planning, and multi-
step execution, making this capability a crucial
indicator of an intelligent system‚Äôs ability to
handle complex tasks (Huang & Chang, 2022;
Gui et al., 2024).
When learning new tasks and solving new prob-
lems, humans are never ‚Äústarting from scratch‚Äù;
rather, they are ‚Äúnearly starting from scratch‚Äù.
This phenomenon is evident in various scenar-
ios: by understanding game rules, humans can
quickly master the gameplay (Nam & McClel-
land, 2024); by learning the basic rules of ad-
dition, humans can easily solve the problem of

Reductio ad absurdum andElimination to solve puzzles (Bill Yuchen Lin, 2024). Human society
is abundant with OOD (Out-of-Distribution) tasks (Liu et al., 2021b)‚Äîthose that are novel and un-
defined‚Äîrequiring continuous adaptation and the ability to navigate new paradigms. Humans have
abilities like abstract, rule-based, and explanatory reasoning, enabling them to learn rules efficiently
and adapt quickly to specific areas.
Similarly, we expect models to develop similar capabilities so that they can still effectively handle
OOD tasks when encountering unfamiliar rules and frameworks, and generate results that conform
to specific rules or settings in real-world applications (Sun et al., 2024). Despite the models‚Äô re-
markable achievements on certain reasoning tasks, the study Mondorf & Plank (2024) points out
that they are still challenged by conceptual errors and limitations when dealing with scenarios be-
yond the training data. While the incorporation of large amounts of code and data during model
training improves the performance of a given task, this improvement is based more on the model‚Äôs
memory of the patterns of the training data than on its increased ability to follow rules or reason.
This reliance on in-domain knowledge limits the effectiveness of existing evaluation benchmarks in
accurately measuring a model‚Äôs reasoning ability (Wu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Dziri et al.,
2023). Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish more comprehensive and effective evaluation
benchmark to measure the ability of models to understand, follow new rules and solve problems
efficiently, while reducing the reliance on pre-trained knowledge.
Inspired by a deeper understanding of the human learning process, we propose the concept of
‚ÄúKnowledge-Orthogonal Reasoning" (KOR) to explore a model‚Äôs capabilities in reading compre-
hension, immediate learning, knowledge transfer, logical reasoning, and problem-solving, while
reducing the reliance on the existing knowledge base. Knowledge Orthogonality, formally defined
in Appendix A, refers to the independence between background/domain-specific knowledge (e.g.,
general knowledge or skills acquired during pre-training) and the rules explicitly defined to solve
a particular task. It ensures that task-solving relies on understanding and reasoning about the task
rules, while background knowledge only aids the reasoning process. ‚ÄúKnowledge-Orthogonal Rea-
soning Benchmark‚Äù (KOR-Bench) focuses on evaluating how models apply newly-defined rules to
solve new rule-driven questions, rather than relying on data retrieval or information memorization.
Specifically, we design a series of tasks to challenge and demonstrate the model‚Äôs reasoning ability
by introducing new elements and rules. These tasks are divided into five categories, each based on
one of the following new elements: new symbols, new concepts, new execution rules, new problem-
solving frameworks, and new story-context settings. The specific categories are as follows:
‚Ä¢Operation Reasoning Task : Understand new definitions of mathematical symbols and
apply this knowledge to perform calculations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
‚Ä¢Logic Reasoning Task : Reason and solve problems based on new logical rules and newly
categorized logical concepts in logical reasoning tasks.
‚Ä¢Cipher Reasoning Task : Perform encryption and decryption operations according to new
execution rules in cryptography reasoning tasks.
‚Ä¢Puzzle Reasoning Task : Solve puzzles and intellectual games based on newly defined
problem-solving frameworks in conditional constraint and combinatorial reasoning tasks.
‚Ä¢Counterfactual Reasoning Task : Engage in hypothetical thinking and reasoning within
new story contexts in conjectural scenario reasoning tasks.
These tasks push models beyond traditional reasoning frameworks by customizing rules and prob-
lems, demonstrating their innovation and adaptability in the face of non-standard problems. We plan
to increase the size of the dataset in the future, explore parameterized rules, deepen the inference
hierarchy, refine the evaluation of the reasoning process, and expand the multimodal version.
2 R ELATED WORK
To comprehensively assess the reasoning capabilities of large language models, researchers have
evaluated them through various benchmark tests, including aspects such as commonsense reasoning
(Bang et al., 2023; Bian et al., 2023; Clark et al., 2018), logical reasoning (Tian et al., 2021; Liu
et al., 2021a; 2023), multi-hop reasoning (Yang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020; Khashabi et al.,
2018), and mathematical reasoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Arora et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023).

According to Chen et al. (2024), the realization of reasoning ability hinges on two core components:
(1) possessing extensive general knowledge of the world, and (2) effectively integrating new infor-
mation into an existing knowledge base. This framework provides a crucial lens through which we
can evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
Knowledge-Dependent Based Evaluation. Most knowledge-dependent benchmarks, such as
MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), Com-
monsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018), and SciQ (Pedersen et al., 2020), assess a model‚Äôs ability to
accumulate and recall data, often struggling to distinguish between true reasoning and simple recall.
Designing reasoning benchmarks is challenging because domain-specific knowledge can obscure
reasoning performance. This raises the question: Is the model reasoning or recalling learned pat-
terns? Benchmarks like GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) target
mathematical reasoning, while FOLIO (Han et al., 2022) and Multi-LogiEval (Patel et al., 2024)
focus on logical reasoning. However, these still rely heavily on domain knowledge, potentially
masking genuine reasoning capabilities.
Information Integration Based Evaluation. Moreover, there is relatively little research on the
ability of (2) models to integrate new information. This imbalance in evaluation hinders a compre-
hensive understanding of the model‚Äôs adaptability and creativity in unfamiliar environments. Some
studies have begun addressing this by testing models on classic puzzles within specific tasks, such
as ZebraLogic (Bill Yuchen Lin, 2024; Berman et al., 2024), Math word problems (Xu et al., 2024),
Mathador-LM Benchmark (Kurtic et al., 2024), BeyondX Benchmark (Kao et al., 2024), Connec-
tions Game (Todd et al., 2024), Cryptic Crosswords (Sadallah et al., 2024), GridPuzzle (Tyagi et al.,
2024), and Crossword Puzzles (Saha et al., 2024). These challenges assess the model‚Äôs logical rea-
soning, spatial cognition, and creative thinking by testing its ability to recognize patterns, apply
logic, and derive insights from given information, highlighting divergent and lateral thinking. Addi-
tionally, Natural Plan (Zheng et al., 2024) and TravelPlanner (Xie et al., 2024), evaluate the models‚Äô
information integration and decision-making skills in complex planning scenarios.
Rule-Following Based Evaluation. Recent evaluations are expanding from instruction-following to
focusing on rule-following capabilities. This trend is exemplified by benchmarks such as RuleBench
(Sun et al., 2024) for general rule following, LOGICGAME (Gui et al., 2024) for execution and
planning reasoning, SearchBench (Borazjanizadeh et al., 2024) for search and problem-solving, and
PuzzleBench (Mittal et al., 2024) for combinatorial reasoning. This shift reflects a growing interest
in assessing models‚Äô reasoning and problem-solving abilities in complex, dynamic environments.
Knowledge Orthogonality Based Evaluation. Building on these research trends, we introduce
the concept of ‚Äúknowledge orthogonality" to address the limitations of current assessment meth-
ods. Our approach aims to reduce the impact of domain-specific knowledge on reasoning ability
assessment, thoroughly examine rule-following capabilities in OOD scenarios, and provide a more
comprehensive and fair evaluation framework.
3 K NOWLEDGE -ORTHOGONAL REASONING BENCHMARK
3.1 O VERVIEW
KOR-Bench contains five categories, each containing 25 manually defined rules that are suitably
modified to ensure that they do not appear in common pre-training data, maintaining a setting that
is orthogonal to domain-specific knowledge. Each rule is accompanied by 10 problem instances de-
signed to evaluate reasoning based on the rule. For a detailed classification of the five task categories
in KOR-Bench, including the number of corresponding rules and the distribution of answer formats,
please refer to Tables 4 and 6 in Appendix C.
3.2 D ATA CONSTRUCTION PROCESS
Data construction for KOR-Bench follows three main phases: (1) Rule Design, (2) Rule-Driven
Q&A Design, and (3) Quality Validation, as shown in Figure 2. The entire data creation process is
carried out primarily through manual annotation, with large language models (LLMs) used only for
quality validation and difficulty filtering. Details of each phase are in Appendix B.

3.3 D ATASET CATEGORIES
3.3.1 O PERATION REASONING
In operation reasoning task, new symbolic operators and corresponding rules are defined, typically
involving an operator and its associated equations. These rules are derived from classical mathe-
matical operations but have been combined or adjusted to align with the concepts and framework of
KOR. These rules cover various levels of difficulty and knowledge domains, ranging from elemen-
tary arithmetic to advanced mathematics. This section not only assesses the model‚Äôs comprehension
of the novel rules but also evaluates its reasoning capabilities in mathematical operations. The model
must be acquainted with classical mathematical operations and apply its understanding of mathemat-
ical knowledge in accordance with the newly defined rules to solve these rule-driven questions. For
specific descriptions of each rule, please refer to Table 8.
3.3.2 L OGIC REASONING
Rules in the logic section are based on traditional logic textbooks and refined with symbolic ad-
justments and innovative definitions to address the specific challenges of KOR-Bench. These rules
assess the model‚Äôs understanding of classical logic and its ability to apply new rules to unconven-
tional problems, demonstrating flexibility and innovation. Ten problems of varying difficulty have
been designed for each rule. A detailed description of each rule is provided in Table 9.
3.3.3 C IPHER REASONING
Cipher section consists of traditional and modern cryptographic methods, which have been modified
to address the specific challenges of KOR-Bench. These methods are based on uncommon encryp-
tion and decryption techniques found on the Braingle and dCode websites. They have been adapted
by altering substitution tables and adjusting certain steps in the encryption process. We verify their
accuracy with encryption and decryption programs and generate examples based on these rules.
This section tests the model‚Äôs ability to understand new rules and reason step-by-step according to
them. Encryption and decryption involve techniques like transposition and rotation, further testing
the model‚Äôs spatial understanding. Table 10 lists the details of each cipher rule.
3.3.4 P UZZLE REASONING
Rules for the puzzle section are divided into three categories: classic paper puzzles (e.g., star bat-
tle), number games (e.g., sudoku and 24-point), and word games (e.g., anagram). The puzzles are

sourced from Braingle and Puzzle Prime, two sites that offer classic and original puzzles, as well as
challenging and entertaining brain games. A detailed description of each puzzle rule is provided in
Table 11. These rules examine not only mathematical, verbal, and spatial reasoning skills but also
the model‚Äôs understanding of the rules and their use in complex, integrated problems. In most cases,
the model has to use a combination of abilities to find the answer. Under each rule, ten problems of
varying difficulty were designed based on that rule.
3.3.5 C OUNTERFACTUAL REASONING
Counterfactual reasoning aims to test the model‚Äôs ability to navigate hypothetical scenarios and adapt
to new rules and environments. This section leverages 25 selected works from anime, television,
film, and game as foundational world settings. Within these settings, the model must derive answers
based on the established worldviews and story rules from the given text information under these
new conditions. In each case, the questions are crafted to deviate from real-life answers, requiring
the model to engage in counterfactual thinking. This tests the model‚Äôs ability to adapt to new rules,
interpret fictional contexts, and engage in complex reasoning beyond conventional real-world logic.
The rule setting for counterfactual reasoning is shown in Table 12.
3.4 S TATISTICS
Table 1 details the KOR-Bench statistics, covering the number and length of rules and questions. Ap-
pendix C provides further details on KOR-Bench. In particular, Table 4 gives a statistical overview
of the number of rules in different categories, illustrating the distribution of rules in each category. In
addition, Table 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 provide detailed summary summaries of the rules for each category
of tasks. Table 7 shows the mean and standard deviation of the input and output tokens for each task
type in KOR-Bench, using GPT-4o as an example. These statistics not only reveal the characteris-

tics of different task types but also help us assess the differences in their specific demands on the
computational resources of the model.

length for five types of reasoning tasks, along with the involved answer formats. The lengths all
refer to the number of characters. We define five answer formats: NR (Numerical Response), ME
(Mathematical Expression), TR (Textual Response), MC (Multiple Choice), and SD (Structured

each format across the different tasks.*
4 E XPERIMENT SETUP
Prompting Strategy. Zero-shot prompting strategy for chat model generates responses based on
newly defined rules and questions, as outlined in prompt template in Appendix D. Base model uses
three-shot strategy, providing three generic Q&A pairs for each rule to support in-context learning.
Evaluation Methodology. We parse the output by regular expression1to try to match the contents
of the double square brackets, and if not found, try to match the single square brackets and clean
the extraction results. To further improve the accuracy of the analysis, we customise the design
of the evaluation script by observing the model‚Äôs output and processing the problems under some
specific rules. After completing the output extraction and special rule processing, it is compared
with the answer. Specifically, for mathematical expressions, SymPy (Meurer et al., 2017) is used for
parsing in LaTeX format and simplifying the expressions for comparison. The accuracy of the model
on each type of task and the overall accuracy on the entire test set are calculated. Comprehensive
details regarding the extraction and evaluation can be found in Appendix C.4.
5 R ESULT ANALYSIS
Table 2 presents the performance of the frontier models on KOR-Bench, revealing several key in-
sights. Overall, accuracy varies significantly across models and task types.
Chat Model Performance. Within the landscape of chat models, O1-Preview ( 72.88% ) and O1-
Mini ( 70.16% ) currently demonstrate the best overall performance, especially excelling in the Ci-
pher and Puzzle reasoning tasks. In the Cipher category, their accuracies reach 82.80% and79.60% ,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o‚Äôs 42.80% . On the Puzzle category, they also achieve superior
accuracies of 36.80% and35.60% , far surpassing GPT-4o‚Äôs 16.80% , further highlighting the advan-
tages of the O1 series models in creative reasoning tasks. Meanwhile, Claude-3.5-Sonnet ( 58.96% )
and GPT-4o ( 58.00% ) follow as the next best-performing models. Claude-3.5-Sonnet shows better
results on Operation and Logic reasoning tasks, especially in Logic reasoning. On the other hand,
GPT-4o performs better on Cipher and Puzzle reasoning tasks, particularly in Cipher reasoning, a
dominance that may be related to its native multimodal nature. This suggests that Claude-3.5-Sonnet
is more accurate in understanding and applying rules, while GPT-4o is better at handling tasks that
require in-depth analysis and creative thinking. Additionally, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct outperforms
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, suggesting that model size alone doesn‚Äôt ensure better performance (McKen-
zie et al., 2023).
Base Model Performance. For base models, Meta-Llama-3.1-405B achieves the highest overall
accuracy at 39.68% . Additionally, the performance of the base model and its associated chat model

shows less decline in the Logic category, compared to a significant drop in other inference tasks.
This difference is likely due to the shallower depth of inference required in the Logic category.
Reasoning Process Performance. When evaluating reasoning abilities, larger models often trigger
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning automatically, applying rules step-by-step and demonstrating
a clear reasoning process in their responses. While they occasionally make execution errors on
complex tasks, their overall rule application remains strong. In contrast, smaller models often fail to
7

activate CoT reasoning.Especially in the Cipher task, smaller models often output "Hello World" as
the answer without any reasoning.
Reasoning Tasks Performance. Across the five types of reasoning tasks, models generally perform
best on the Counterfactual reasoning task, indicating an apparent strength in literal reasoning com-
pared to tasks involving mathematical, logical, or theoretical reasoning. Following that, they also
perform well on Operation and Logic reasoning tasks, which typically involve one or two levels of
reasoning. However, aside from the O1 series models, the models struggle with Cipher and Puzzle
reasoning tasks, with a maximum accuracy of 42.80% on the Cipher task and just 16.80% on the
Puzzle task, revealing significant weaknesses in handling deeper reasoning challenges.
Single Task Analysis. Models struggle with algebraic problems involving unknowns but perform
better in forward symbolic computation in Operation reasoning. In Logic reasoning, construct-
ing correct logical expressions remains difficult due to symbolic complexity. In Cipher reasoning,
errors are most frequent in Position Mapping, Transpose Writing, and Mathematical Calculation,
along with Split Connection and Multi-Step Execution. Puzzle reasoning reveals strengths in single-
solution tasks but challenges in multi-step and spatial reasoning. In Counterfactual reasoning, as
overall model accuracy increases, the ratio of real-life answers decreases, suggesting an error from
the models‚Äô fixed knowledge. Chat models‚Äô real-life answer ratios stay below 15% , while base mod-
els improve to 36.8% as accuracy drops (see Figures 6 and 7 in Appendix E). Appendix G provides
error case studies for each task.
6 F URTHER ANALYSIS
We select 16 models for a detailed analysis of their reasoning behaviors, including Claude-3.5-
Sonnet, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V2.5, and six model series: Meta-Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5, Qwen2, Yi,
Command-R, and Mistral. For each series, we include one large model and one small model. The
experiments aim to examine their characteristics, with further details in Appendix F.

In the Cipher Reasoning task, we select five highly erroneous rules and, with human expertise, break
down the solution process into sequential sub-steps to guide the LLM in solving the problem step by
step. This allows us to perform stepwise prompting analysis, pinpointing challenges and bottlenecks
in the reasoning process. There are 9 types of these sub-steps, as detailed in Table 13. Figure 4 shows
the accuracy of models on cipher sub-steps and the error rates across nine types of sub-steps. An
example of dividing a problem into sub-steps is provided in the Appendix F.1.2.

Results show that error rates for Encoding andPartition are relatively low, indicating these are not
major factors in Cipher reasoning. Error rates for Shift ,Mapping , and Substitution are higher,
suggesting these sub-steps are more challenging. High error rates for Calculation indicate com-
plex calculations affect reasoning. Error rates for Rotation ,Conditional Filling , and Conditional
Reading are nearly 100%, suggesting spatial operations are a bottleneck. Model error rates across
all sub-steps are detailed in Appendix F.1.3.
6.2 A NALYSIS ON SELF-CORRECTION
Figure 5: Self-Correction‚Äôs Impact on Overall Accuracy.
We conduct the Self-Correction experiment to guide the model in identifying errors, reflecting on
their causes, and improving reasoning accuracy. Figure 5 illustrates the results of model self-
correction in KOR-Bench. With a maximum of 5 rounds, the history may exceed the model‚Äôs context
window, requiring the extraction of the previous round‚Äôs response for re-input. This process involves
identifying the relevant response for inclusion in the next input sequence. Appendix F.4.1 provides
the self-correction prompt template used for this purpose.
All models show a significant performance improvement after self-correction, with an average in-
crease of 10.36% . Detailed results are in Appendix F.4.2. Figure 11 shows the correction rate from
the model‚Äôs perspective, with the most significant improvement in the first two rounds, and limited
gains in later rounds. Figure 12 presents the correction rate by task category, with the Counterfactual
category achieving the highest rate of 44.05% in the first round, and strong corrections in the first
two rounds for the other categories, diminishing in the last two rounds.
6.3 A NALYSIS ON COMPLEX TASK PROCESSING
The Complex Task Processing experiment evaluates the model‚Äôs ability to apply rules to solve mul-
tiple problems, manage longer reasoning chains, and test reasoning robustness. It includes three
settings: (1) Multi-Q: 1 rule, 1-10 questions ;(2) Multi-R: 2-3 rules, 1 question ;(3) Multi-RQ:
2-3 rules, 1-3 questions . See Appendix F.5.1 and Appendix F.5.2 for evaluation details. Each set-
ting contains random combinations of five reasoning task types, with 1000 examples per type. The
model‚Äôs task is to extract relevant information, reason deeply, and solve problems efficiently.
Table 3 displays the model performance. Claude-3.5-Sonnet consistently performs the best across
all settings, demonstrating a robust overall capability and resilience against interference. Yi-Large
and GPT-4o show similar performance. Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 performs significantly worse in

6.4 M ORE EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSES
Appendix F.2 provides an analysis of model performance after the introduction of the Trick field
in the puzzle task. Appendix F.3 gives the experimental setup and analysis of the Rule-Focused
Attention Visualization based on Retrieval Head (Wu et al., 2024), which can be an effective tool for
improving interpretability. The generated file is a PDF highlighting the attention distribution, which
can also be utilized for future expansions of the vision version. Appendix H includes some generated
examples for reference. Appendix I demonstrates the robustness of KOR-Bench to size variations
through an ablation study. Correlations with other benchmarks show a stronger alignment with
reasoning-focused benchmarks, particularly MMLU-Pro(refer to Appendix J for details). Finally,
we evaluate the model‚Äôs ability to recognize patterns and extract reasoning rules through zero-shot
and three-shot "only questions" experiments. In the zero-shot setting, models rely solely on prior
knowledge, often struggling with accuracy due to insufficient information. In the three-shot setting,
models infer rules from three examples, improving performance, as detailed in Appendix K.
7 C ONCLUSION
By maintaining orthogonality with domain-specific knowledge, we introduce KOR-Bench to evalu-
ate models‚Äô reasoning abilities in reading comprehension, immediate learning, knowledge transfer,
logical reasoning, and problem-solving, while minimizing the influence of pre-existing knowledge.
KOR-Bench provides substantial differentiation and poses a significant challenge, as evidenced by
O1-Preview and O1-Mini achieving 72.88% and 70.16%, respectively, while advanced models like
Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o score only 58.96% and 58.00%. We aim for KOR-Bench to be a
comprehensive and challenging benchmark that evaluates models‚Äô reasoning abilities while decou-
pling them from intrinsic knowledge, ultimately advancing research in reasoning and planning.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday applications, demanding robust
general reasoning capabilities and diverse reasoning skillset. However, current LLM reasoning bench-
marks predominantly focus on mathematical and coding abilities, leaving a gap in evaluating broader
reasoning proficiencies. One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a
crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of
challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills
within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and
its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many
tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard
(BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces
each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly
increased difficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average accuracy of
9.8% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating
substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general
reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh .

Figure 1|Model performances on BBEH (harmonic mean

strides in evaluating the reasoning capa-
bilities of large language models (LLMs),
but the focus has been disproportion-
ately skewed towards math/science and
coding. This emphasis is likely driven
by the availability of challenging bench-
marks in these domains and the relative
ease of evaluating quantitative solutions.
However, reasoning encompasses a far
broader spectrum of cognitive skills, in-
cluding logical deduction, temporal and
spatial understanding, commonsense reasoning, and even the ability to comprehend humor.
To assess these diverse facets of reasoning, the community has relied on the BIG-Bench benchmark
(Srivastava et al., 2022), specifically its more challenging subset, BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun
et al., 2022). BBH has served as the de facto standard for evaluating general reasoning in LLMs due
to its versatility and the wide array of reasoning skills it probes. However, the rapid advancements in
LLM development has led to a saturation of BBH, with state-of-the-art models achieving over 90%
accuracy. This performance ceiling renders BBH less effective in discriminating between the reasoning
abilities of the latest generation of LLMs.

BIG-Bench Extra Hard
To address this challenge and push the boundaries of LLM evaluation, we introduce BIG-Bench
Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to assess advanced reasoning capabilities. BBEH
builds upon BBH by replacing each of the 23 tasks from BBH with a novel counterpart that probes
similar reasoning capabilities, but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. Solving the tasks in BBEH
requires even further reasoning skills than the problems in BBH. These skills include, but are not
limited to, many-hop reasoning, learning on the fly, finding errors in reasoning traces, processing
long-context inputs and finding (multi-)needles in a haystack, going against strong prior, dealing
with long-range dependencies, dealing with distractors and inducing patterns from examples. By
presenting LLMs with problems that demand a wider array of reasoning capabilities, BBEH aims to
provide a more accurate measure of their general reasoning abilities.
We provide a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs on BBEH. Our results
demonstratethatBBEHpresentsasignificantchallengeevenforthemostadvancedmodels. Specifically,
we observe a ceiling accuracy of 23.9% for the best general-purpose model and 54.2% for the model
reasoning-specializedmodel,highlightingthesubstantialheadroomforimprovementinrobustgeneral
reasoning for LLM. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed failure analysis, revealing intriguing failure
modes for both general-purpose LLMs and models specifically designed for reasoning and thinking.
These findings offer valuable insights into the current limitations of LLMs and provide guidance for
future research aimed at enhancing their reasoning capabilities.
2. Related Work
There has been significant emphasis on using LLMs for mathematical and scientific reasoning. This has
led to the popularity and proliferation of math- and STEM-based evaluations, such as (Cobbe et al.,
2021; Hendrycks et al., 2020), and more recently, (Glazer et al., 2024; Phan et al., 2025). However,
the generalizability of mathematical reasoning skills to broader domains remains unclear. Indeed,
attempts to make existing benchmarks more robust‚Äîfor example, Mirzadeh et al. (2024)‚Äîhave
highlighted an overall lack of robustness and logical reasoning capabilities. Several benchmarks have
also been developed to address specific areas of reasoning, including temporal reasoning (Beniwal
et al., 2024; Dhingra et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2024), spatial understanding (Bohnet et al., 2024;
Mirzaee et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2022; Yamada et al., 2023), commonsense reasoning (Sakaguchi
et al., 2021; Talmor et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019), and logical reasoning (Parmar et al., 2024;
Saparov and He, 2022; Saparov et al., 2023; Tafjord et al., 2020). However, these benchmarks tend
to focus narrowly on specific domains, leading to potential evaluation biases if a more holistic view
of model capabilities is not considered. To address this limitation, several benchmarks have been
developed to integrate multiple tasks into a single evaluation framework, including (Hendrycks et al.,
2020; Kazemi et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2023; Parmar et al., 2024; Srivastava et al., 2022; Wang, 2018;
Wang et al., 2019, 2024; Weston et al., 2015). Our work builds on this line of research, introducing
a new set of challenging tasks for future model evaluation and performance improvement. The
multi-task nature of our benchmark with fine-grained tasks each focused on some reasoning skills
enables model developers to discover and analyze failure modes in further depth. Note that while
private initiatives such as ChatBot Arena (lmarena) and the SEAL leaderboard (ScaleAI) conduct
model evaluations across various aspects, they may suffer from several potential issues as pointed
out in Bansal and Maini (2024). Our benchmark provides an open evaluation framework with an
automatic and deterministic scoring mechanism, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility for
the broader research community.

BIG-Bench Extra Hard
3. Going Beyond BIG-Bench Hard
BIG-Bench, and its later subset BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), have served the research community for
several years as de facto benchmarks for measuring general reasoning capabilities. Here, we mainly
focus on BBH which has been favored in the recent years. We believe three key factors in the success
of BBH were the following: 1- it was challenging even for the frontier models at the time, thus helping
reveal model shortcomings and areas for improvement, 2- despite being composed of various tasks, all
the questions in BBH were in a way that allowed for simple correctness verification of model responses
with a few simple rules, and 3- perhaps most importantly, it tested for a vast array of reasoning skills
making it a good proxy for measuring general reasoning. The latter factor is in contrast to many
existing reasoning benchmarks that test only for a few of these skills as explained in the related work
section.
Despite the great success of BBH and its widespread use, it also exhibited some key limitations.
Firstly, a random chance baseline already has a high performance on BBH due to the high number
of tasks with limited options (8/23 of the tasks have binary labels, and another 5/23 have at most
5 options to choose from). Secondly, some of the problems in BBH can be solved using shortcuts
without solving the problem (for example, in the geometric shapes task, whenever there are three L
commands the answer is triangle). Thirdly, while real-world reasoning problems typically require
processing large amounts of input texts, the input lengths of the problems in BBH are often quite
short with a macro average of 700 characters across tasks. Fourthly, since the problems were made to
be challenging for the LLMs of the time, they typically require only few hops of reasoning. And finally,
while BBH tests for a quite large and diverse set of skills, the set can be greatly expanded to include
even more reasoning skills. The fast pace of improvement in the reasoning ability of the latest LLMs
coupled with the limitations of the BBH dataset outlined above has led to BBH getting saturated with
latest models achieving accuracies in the range of 90+ percent on it, thus causing BBH to disappear
from the latest model evaluation reports.
We create a challenging benchmark for measuring the general reasoning capability of LLMs by
using BBH as a guide: we preserve the positive aspects of BBH and lift the limitations as much as
possible. Specifically, wecreateabenchmarkthatischallengingforthefrontiermodels,thecorrectness
of the model responses can be verified automatically despite being composed of several sub-tasks,
the random chance baseline has a much lower success rate and the shortcuts are removed from the
problems as much as possible, problems require processing longer inputs and require significantly
more hops of reasoning to be solved, and, perhaps most importantly, covers a wide array of reasoning
skills including those in the original BBH dataset and beyond. Through studying the 23 tasks in
BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), we identify that for a reasoner to perform well on BBH it needs to have
at least the following broad reasoning skills: 1- temporal understanding, 2- spatial and geometric
understanding, 3- commonsense understanding, 4- humour understanding, 5- causal understanding,
6- reasoning about world entities and events, 7- deductive logical reasoning, 8- reasoning through
linguisticknowledge, 9-countingandfiltering, 10-datastructuresandalgorithms, and11-performing
arithmetic operations.
For our benchmark, we wish to preserve the high diversity of the reasoning skills and capabilities
from BBH and also expand upon it by including more of the following skills. 1- Many-hop reasoning:
The ability to solve a problem that require many steps/hops, 2- Very long-range dependency: the
ability to remember and use information that have been provided or concluded much earlier in the
context, 3- Going against strong prior: the ability to reason through a problem even when it does
not match the prior beliefs (McKenzie et al. (2023) report inverse scaling behaviours in such cases),
4-Learning on the fly: the able to learn something new on the fly (i.e. from the information in the
context) and apply it to solve a problem, 5- Dealing with distractors: The ability to identify the

4. BIG-Bench Extra Hard
We create BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a dataset that tests the general reasoning capability of
models on a wide array of reasoning skills. To this end, we build on the success of BBH and replace
each of the 23 tasks in BBH with another task that is in a similar reasoning domain and tests for
similar (or more) skills, but is more challenging compared to the original one. Replacing each task
with another one in the same domain that tests for similar capabilities ensures that we preserve the
high diversity of original BBH dataset. In Table 1, we outline a high-level description of the new tasks
in BBEH, how they have been constructed and which task from BBH the replace, and what reasoning
skills they target. The benchmark contains 200questions per task, except for the Disambiguation QA
task where we have 120questions. For more details about the tasks and some intuitions from the
experimental results and model failure modes, see Appendix A. Samples from a few of our tasks are
provided in Figure 2.
A key challenge in creating benchmarks is ensuring they remain difficult for frontier models. This
is particularly true for reasoning benchmarks, given the rapid progress in the field over the past
year, and especially for BBEH, which comprises 23 distinct tasks, each requiring careful design. To
ensure our tasks challenge frontier models, we adopted a semi-adversarial approach. We selected
two strong reference models: one general-purpose and one specialized in reasoning. We iteratively
increased task difficulty while keeping in mind the extra skills that we wanted our benchmark to test
for, evaluating the reference models on each new iteration. If a task proved insufficiently challenging,
we either replaced it with another task or added extra types of difficulty and re-evaluated until the
difficulty level was satisfactory. We used Gemini 1.5 Flash (Team et al., 2024a) as our general-purpose
reference model and the Gemini Thinking Experimental model as our reasoning-specialized reference
model (initially the December 2024 version but later changed to the January 2025 version, known as
Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp-01-21). These models were chosen for their performance and the
speed of generating outputs, which facilitated rapid iteration during task construction. We iterated
on each task until both reference models achieved an accuracy below 70%.
In most cases, we tried to use the reference models only as a black box that provided feedback
on the difficulty of our tasks. In some cases, however, making tasks more difficult required looking
into the approach adopted by the model. As an example, the original "Boolean Expression" task in
BBH required models to evaluate the truth value of expressions such as (not True) or False . Our initial
attempt to increase difficulty involved creating longer expressions with significantly more clauses.
However, our reference model achieved high accuracy regardless of the number of clauses. While
initially this seemed surprising, upon investigating the model‚Äôs approach, we discovered it cleverly
used Python to solve the problem by directly evaluating the expression: result = <expression>;

Abstract
We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities
of large language models (LLMs) and their scal-
ability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To
this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehen-
sive evaluation framework for assessing LLM rea-
soning performance on logic grid puzzles derived
from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Ze-
braLogic enables the generation of puzzles with
controllable and quantifiable complexity, facili-
tating a systematic study of the scaling limits of
models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-
R1. By encompassing a broad range of search
space complexities and diverse logical constraints,
ZebraLogic provides a structured environment
to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty.
Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy
as problem complexity grows‚Äîa phenomenon we
term the ‚Äúcurse of complexity.‚Äù This limitation
persists even with larger models and increased
inference-time computation, suggesting inherent
constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance
logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling,
backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification
prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into
the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fun-
damental limitations, and outline potential direc-
tions for improvement.

Logical reasoning stands as a cornerstone of human intel-
ligence and remains a central challenge in AI. While re-
cent advances have demonstrated promise in tasks requiring
common sense and general knowledge (Brown et al., 2020;
Chowdhery et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023), the capabili-
ties of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling complex
deductive problems remain uncertain. This limitation in our
understanding is especially critical as systematic reasoning
underpins many real-world applications. To systematically
study LLMs‚Äô logical reasoning capabilities and their scal-
ing limits, an ideal evaluation framework must: (1) isolate
pure logical reasoning from domain knowledge; (2) enable
precise control over problem complexity; (3) minimize data
leakage to prevent training data memorization; (4) provide
objective metrics for assessing an LLM‚Äôs reasoning results.
Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) offer such a con-
trolled framework (Dechter, 2003): they are mathematically
well-defined, scalable in both complexity and search space,
and have solutions that can be automatically verified. By for-
mulating logical tasks as CSPs, we can rigorously evaluate
how well LLMs adhere to logical constraints, independent
of domain-specific data or heavy numerical computation.
As a representative class of CSPs, logic grid puzzles (specif-
ically Zebra Puzzles or Einstein‚Äôs Riddle, (Prosser, 1993))
are particularly suitable as they require pure formal rea-
soning, remain accessible enough to serve as an effective
testbed, and embody core skills relevant to real-world ap-
plications such as task planning, scheduling, and resource
allocation. Hence, we introduce ZebraLogic , an evaluation
framework for creating logic puzzles with controllable, and
quantifiable complexity, thus improving our understanding
on the scaling limits of LLMs including Llama (AI@Meta,
2024), o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025).1
Through extensive evaluation of various LLMs across di-

on a detailed analysis of the kinds of errors LLMs make when
solving grid puzzles using reasoning chains; more details in ¬ß7.

verse architectures and sizes, we observe a dramatic de-
cline in performance as puzzle complexity increases‚Äîa
phenomenon we term the ‚Äú curse of complexity for reason-
ing.‚Äù Most models struggle once the puzzle‚Äôs search space
exceeds 107possibilities (e.g., for puzzles with 4x5 grid
size) or when the number of logical conflicts in a widely
used SMT solver named Z3 (de Moura & Bj√∏rner, 2008)
surpasses 20. These findings suggest that limited reason-
ing in current LLMs are not solely a matter of model- or
sample-size scaling, but also arise from insufficient test-time
compute. This shortfall underscores the need to train LLMs
to reason step by step (Wei et al., 2022) explicitly (e.g., via
reinforcement learning (Lambert et al., 2024a)), as exem-
plified by emerging reasoning models such as o1 and R1.
Specifically, we conduct a systematic investigation into the
scaling behavior of LLMs in logical reasoning, focusing on
three key dimensions: model size ( ¬ß4), sampling ( ¬ß5), and
test-time compute ( ¬ß6). Understanding scaling behavior of
LLMs in reasoning is critical to identify the most promising
directions for advancing LLMs‚Äô reasoning capabilities and
to guide future research efforts more effectively.
Our work makes the following key contributions:
‚Ä¢We create the ZebraLogic dataset, a benchmark of 1,000
logic grid puzzles spanning multiple complexity levels,
designed to evaluate LLMs‚Äô logical reasoning capabilities
systematically with two complexity metrics: search space
size and Z3 conflict count (¬ß2).
‚Ä¢We report ‚Äúthe curse of complexity‚Äù in logical reason-
ing with LLMs: the performance dramatically declines
as the problem complexity increases and after a certain
threshold, most models struggle to solve any logical puz-
zle. This limitation persists even when scaling to signifi-
cantly larger models (such as Llama-3.1-405B) or using
enhanced training data, indicating a deeper challenge thatcannot be resolved by model scaling alone (¬ß3 and ¬ß4).
‚Ä¢We scale the test-time compute of LLMs by increasing the
number of generation samples, revealing that it has both
promise and challenges. While Best-of-N sampling can
improve potential performance, practical selection meth-
ods like majority voting or reward models show limited
improvement. Additionally, even pass@128 cannot break
the curse of complexity (¬ß5).
‚Ä¢We find that it‚Äôs much more promising to scale up the
reasoning tokens (i.e., chain-of-thoughts; CoTs) generated
during inference with a backtracking mechanism. We
take OpenAI‚Äôs o1 models as a typical example and show
that they generate significantly more, nearly 10x (hidden)
reasoning tokens than others, which scale properly with
problem complexity. Based on our empirical results, we
also find that there exists an optimal ratio of reasoning
tokens to Z3 conflicts, but O1-like models cannot always
reach this optimal ratio when the complexity is extremely
high, thus not achieving perfect reasoning (¬ß6).
‚Ä¢Moreover, we explore the potential of using self-
verification prompting to improve LLMs ( ¬ß6.2). We find
that such methods can help LLMs improve their perfor-
mance, but the improvement is very marginal. We fur-
ther analyze the reasoning process of o1 and discuss its
strengths and weakness in logical reasoning (¬ßD).
2. Problem Formulation of Logical Reasoning
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) provide a power-
ful framework for modeling and solving logical reasoning
tasks. In CSPs, solutions must satisfy a set of constraints
over variables and their possible values. This framework
is particularly valuable for evaluating systematic reason-
ing capabilities, as it requires explicit handling of logical
relationships and dependencies. We leverage this frame-

these clues, as illustrated in the Solution grid.
work through logic grid puzzles in our ZebraLogic dataset
to assess LLMs‚Äô deductive reasoning abilities.
2.1. Logic Grid Puzzles
Each puzzle in ZebraLogic consists of Nhouses (numbered
1 toNfrom left to right) and Mdifferent attributes for
each house. There are Ndistinct values for each attribute,
and each house must have a unique value for each attribute.
Given a list of Kclues, one must use logical deduction to
determine the unique correct assignment of values. Figure 2
illustrates an example of such a puzzle, as well as a reason-
ing chain for solving it. Importantly, while some ZebraLogic
puzzles can be solved through straightforward linear deduc-
tion, many require more complex non-monotonic reasoning
strategies, such as counterfactual reasoning that involves
backtracking and revising assumptions. This is particularly
true as the search space grows larger and the clues become
more intricate ‚Äì a key aspect of our study on the scaling
behavior of LLMs.
2.2. Problem Formulation
We provide a detailed mathematical formulation of logic
grid puzzles as a CSP. This formulation not only clarifies
the underlying structure of the puzzles in ZebraLogic but
also highlights how our study can be generalized to various
reasoning problems. The example shown in Fig. 2 illustrates
this formulation.
Background. Consider Nhouses numbered 1 to N. Each
house has a different occupant with a set AofMunique
attributes such as name, favorite drink, hobby, etc. Each
attribute a‚àà A represents a category of characteristics
and takes values in a set VaofNpossible values. Forexample, for the attribute Name , we might have VName =
{Eric,Peter,Arnold }in a puzzle with N= 3 houses. As
illustrated in Fig. 2, other attributes might include Drink
with values like milk, water, and tea, or Hobby with val-
ues like photography, cooking, and gardening. To model
the puzzle as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, we define
variables representing the assignment of values to attributes
for each house.
‚Ä¢ Let H={1,2,3,¬∑¬∑¬∑} be the set of houses, |H|=N.
‚Ä¢LetA={Name ,Drink ,¬∑¬∑¬∑} be the set of attributes, |A|=M.
‚Ä¢ Define xa,k‚àà Vafor each attribute a‚àà A and house k‚ààH.
Uniqueness Constraints: The constraints ensure that each
value is assigned exactly once, as described in the Back-
ground part in Figure 2. For each attribute, the set of as-
signed values across all houses must exactly match the set
of possible values. That is: {xa,k|k‚ààH}=Va.
Clue-Based Constraints: Each clue in the puzzle intro-
duces additional constraints that must be satisfied by any
valid assignment. Note that there are also several implicit
positional constraints that must be considered. For example,
the leftmost house cannot be on the right of any other house,
and the rightmost house cannot be on the left of any other
house (as relevant in Clue 4). These spatial constraints,
combined with the explicit clues, translate the verbal de-
scriptions into precise logical conditions to be satisfied..
Under the hood, these clues are translated into formal logic
formulas that constrain the relationships between variables.
For our example puzzle in Figure 2, the constraints can be
formulated as follows:
Task. The task is to find an assignment of attributes to
houses via assigning values to variables xa,kthat is consis-
tent with all constraints. These constraints, defined above,

ues and the logical conditions derived from the specific clues
provided. The result is guaranteed to be unique, and can be
usually presented as a table as shown in Fig. 2.

2.3. ZebraLogic Dataset Creation
To create puzzles, we first define a set of attributes and
their corresponding value sets. We also establish some
clue types, each with its own language templates containing
placeholders for values.
Attributes and Values. We construct the attribute set A,
which includes the many elements (see Appendix B). Each
attribute is associated with a minimum of 6 possible values,
ensuring a rich and diverse set of puzzles. Importantly,
we always include the Name attribute in our samples, as it
serves as a crucial element in the puzzle-solving process.
Clue Types. The possible clue types are categorized into
several types, including FOUND AT,SAME HOUSE ,NOTAT,
DIRECT LEFT/RIGHT ,SIDEBYSIDE,LEFT/RIGHT OF, and
ONE/TWOBETWEEN . Each clue type captures a specific
relationship between variables, providing a diverse set of
constraints for the puzzles. More details are in Appendix B.
Clue Types and Illustrative Examples.
‚Ä¢FOUND AT: The tea drinker lives in House 3.
‚Ä¢SAME HOUSE : The musician drinks tea.
‚Ä¢NOTAT: The musician does not drink tea (not at the same
house).
‚Ä¢DIRECT LEFT/RIGHT : The greenhouse is directly to the
left/right of the white house.
‚Ä¢SIDEBYSIDE: The coffee drinker and the tea drinker are
next to each other.
‚Ä¢LEFT/RIGHT OF: A is somewhere to the left/right of B.
‚Ä¢ONE/TWOBETWEEN : 1/2 houses are between A & B.

for generating ZebraLogic puzzles. The process starts byAlgorithm 1 ZebraLogic Puzzle Generation.

sampling Mattributes from the full attribute set and creating
an initial solution grid Sthrough random value assignments.
From this solution, we generate a comprehensive set of clues
Cthat capture all valid relationships between values in the
grid. The algorithm then employs an iterative minimization
procedure - at each step, it randomly samples a clue p‚àà C
and attempts to remove it. Using a SAT solver, it verifies
whether the reduced clue set C‚Ä≤=C \ {p}still uniquely
determines the original solution S. If uniqueness is pre-
served, pis permanently removed and the process continues.
This iteration terminates when no any additional clue can
be removed without augmenting the solution space.
We employ weighted sampling during clue selection, assign-
ing higher probabilities to simpler clue types (e.g., FOUN -
DAT-type clues are more likely to be sampled than NOTAT)
to balance puzzle complexity, such that we can efficiently
reduce the clue set while maintaining the difficulty of the
puzzles. The result is a minimal set of clues that, when
combined with the background information about the at-
tributes and their possible values, forms a logically sound
puzzle with a single, unique solution. This approach en-
sures that each generated puzzle is both solvable and chal-
lenging, requiring a combination of logical deduction and
non-monotonic reasoning strategies to solve. Finally, we
use predefined one-shot prompting templates to format the
puzzle and instruct the LLMs to generate their reasoning
steps and final results in a JSON format (see Appendix D.1).
Dataset Statistics. The dataset consists of 1,000 puzzles
where the size of the search space varies significantly. The
puzzles are based on N√óMgrids where N, M‚àà {2, ...,6}
(i.e., 25 sizes in total, with 40 puzzles per size), covering a
wide range of complexity. The average and median number
of clues per instance is 10.4and9, respectively.

2.4. Theoretical Problem Complexity
By reduction from the Quasigroup (or Latin square) Com-
pletion Problem (QCP) (Colbourn, 1984; Gomes & Shmoys,
2002), the ZebraLogic problem is proven to be NP-complete
(Sempolinski, 2009). While the problem definition includes
a rich set of clue types that can be further expanded, a suffi-
cient condition for the NP-completeness result is to at least
include the FOUND ATandNOTATclue types. As a result,
while a solution to a ZebraLogic puzzle can be easily ver-
ified, solving ZebraLogic puzzles for large instances may
become intractable within reasonable time frames using cur-
rent computational methods. This implies that, for a fixed
LLM size, the required number of reasoning tokens may
increase exponentially with the size of the puzzle.
2.5. Measuring Effective Instance Complexity
Search space size. We define the solution space of a Ze-
braLogic puzzle as the total number of possible configu-
rations that can satisfy the uniqueness constraints of the
puzzle. That is, a N√óMgrid has a solution space of
(N!)M, where Nis the number of houses and Mis the
number of attributes. The complexity of the search space
increases factorially with the size of the grid, leading to
a combinatorial explosion in the number of possible con-
figurations.2To better group the puzzles based on their
complexity, we categorize them into four groups based on
the size of the search space |S|:
Small (|S|<103):2√ó2, 2√ó3, 2√ó4, 2√ó5, 2√ó6, 3√ó2, 3√ó3, 4√ó2
Medium (103‚â§ |S| <106):3√ó4, 3√ó5, 3√ó6, 4√ó3, 4√ó4, 5√ó2, 6√ó2
Large (106‚â§ |S| <1010):4√ó5, 5√ó3, 4√ó6, 5√ó4, 6√ó3
X-Large (|S| ‚â• 1010):5√ó5, 6√ó4, 5√ó6, 6√ó5, 6√ó6
Z3 conflicts. While search space size provides a useful mea-
sure of puzzle scale, it is not the only indicator of complexity.
To complement it, we also use the Z3 SMT solver‚Äôs conflict
metric. Z3 (de Moura & Bj√∏rner, 2008) uses the Conflict
Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm, a backtracking
approach based on the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-
Loveland) algorithm. When solving a puzzle, Z3 records
the number of conflicts encountered - situations where the
solver must backtrack due to contradictions in its current
assignment. We run Z3 on each puzzle for 32 times and
take the average number of conflicts as a measure of com-
plexity. Puzzles with zero conflicts can typically be solved
through simple forward chaining, whereas puzzles with
more conflicts require extensive backtracking, indicating
higher logical complexity.
While search space size captures the number of candidate
assignments (given uniqueness constraints), Z3 conflicts
quantify the solver‚Äôs difficulty in reaching a valid solution.
2For example, a 3x4 grid has a solution space of (3!)4= 1296 ,
while a 4x3 grid has a solution space of (4!)3= 13824 .Together, these metrics offer a complementary view of how
the difficulty of the puzzles scales with the problem size.
Appendix B provides additional details on how these two
metrics vary as a function of the puzzle parameters ( N,M).
3. Evaluation
Setup and Metrics. Our evaluation is done in a one-shot
in-context learning setting, where we provide the models
with a single example of how to solve a ZebraLogic puzzle
and present the solution in JSON format, and we instruct
the LLMs to output their reasoning and solution in the same
format, thus making it easier to parse and evaluate their an-
swers. We mainly look at the puzzle-level accuracy, mean-
ing that only when all cells in the grid are filled correctly, the
model is considered to have solved the puzzle. In addition
to that, we also report the cell-level accuracy.
Evaluated models. We evaluate both open-weight LLMs
(e.g., Llama and Qwen) and proprietary LLM APIs includ-
ing GPT-4o, O1 and Claude models. All evaluated models
are prompted in the same way (see Appendix D.1), and
we use the same greedy decoding and prompts and parsing
script across all models to ensure a fair comparison, except
for O1, which does not only greedy decoding so we run it
three times and take the best result.
3.1. Main results
Table 1 shows the performance of various models. o1 out-
performs all other models, achieving an overall accuracy
of 81.0%, and DeepSeek-R1, an open-weight reasoning
LLM achieves 78.7%, with a slightly better performance on
Small and Medium-size puzzles than o1-full. However, R1‚Äôs
performance on Large and X-Large puzzles is worse than o1-
full. o1-preview and o1-mini achieve 71.4% and 59.7% ac-
curacy, respectively. In contrast, the best-performing open-
weight non-reasoning LLM, Sonnet-3.5-1022, only reaches
36.2%. The performance gap is even more pronounced in
larger search spaces, where O1-Preview maintains a 17.0%
accuracy in the X-Large category, while other models strug-
gle to achieve any correct solutions.
We find that our ranking and scoring of these models
are aligned with other reasoning benchmarks such as
MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) for mathematical reasoning
and LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) for competitive pro-
gramming. This suggests that the logical reasoning ability
of LLMs is highly correlated with their performance on
other types of reasoning tasks.
3.2. Curse of Complexity in Reasoning with LLMs
We observe that the performance of LLMs drops signifi-
cantly as the search space size increases, as shown in Fig. 1
and Fig. 3 (in Appendix). We find that for models that are

correctly. We also report the accuracy on small, medium, large, and x-large groups based on the size of the search space (see
Sec. 2.3). The cell accuracy indicates the percentage of individual cells filled correctly. See Appx. A for more model results.
overall worse than GPT-4o-mini can hardly solve puzzles
beyond the Small category ‚Äî less than 5% accuracy in
Medium-size puzzles and almost no correct solutions in
Large and X-Large puzzles. We can see that even the largest
open-weight LLM, Llama-3.1-405B, only achieves 32.6%
overall accuracy. Although 405B has 22.5% accuracy in
Medium-size puzzles, it quickly also drops to 1.5% in the
Large category and 0.0% in the X-Large category.
The best non-reasoning LLM, Sonnet 3.5, has 36.2% ac-
curacy in the overall evaluation, but it also drops to 4.0%
in the Large category and 1.0% in the X-Large category.
This indicates that the logical reasoning tasks in ZebraLogic
are extremely challenging for LLMs, especially for puzzles
with more complexity ‚Äì with larger search spaces or harder
clues. We can also see that scaling up the model size does
not necessarily improve the performance of LLMs in logical
reasoning tasks with large search spaces.
3.3. Scaling Behavior of LLMs in Logical Reasoning
In the following sections, we study the scaling behavior
of LLMs in logical reasoning, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Our
analysis focuses on two primary types of scaling: 1) scaling
model size and 2) scaling test-time compute. For test-time
compute, we further explore three sub-dimensions: 1) the
number of candidate samples, 2) the number of reasoning
tokens (i.e., CoT tokens) generated during inference, and 3)the sample size for repeated sampling.
4. Scaling Model Size Can Hardly Break the
Curse of Complexity in Reasoning
The Curse of Complexity in Reasoning for non-reasoning
LLMs. In addition to the search space size, we also use
Z3-conflict as the complexity measure to study the scaling
behavior LLMs. Fig. 1 (left) highlights a key observation
regarding the performance of various Llama models with
different model sizes across an increasing complexity in
terms of how many Z3 conflicts on average are encountered
when solving the ZebraLogic puzzles. A notable finding is
that all model sizes experience a rapid decline in accuracy
as the complexity increases, illustrating the challenge posed
by complex reasoning tasks. This trend emphasizes the
inherent difficulty models face in maintaining high accuracy
beyond a certain threshold of search complexity, irrespective
of their size. The phenomenon termed as the ‚Äúcurse of
complexity‚Äù becomes evident as even the largest models,
such as the Llama-3.1-405B, cannot sustain high accuracy
once the search space surpasses a certain scale. As shown
in Fig. 3, we see a similar trend in the search space size.
Scaling model size is only effective for smaller search
spaces. However, it is important to note the significant bene-
fits of scaling model size when the search space is relatively
small (e.g., ‚â§106). In these cases, larger models like the

Figure 3: Accuracy vs Search Space Size (log scale) comparing multiple scaling behavior of LLMs on ZebraLogic. Left:
Scaling model sizes. Right: Scaling test-time compute through two approaches - increasing sample size (via pass@k
evaluation) and extending chain-of-thought reasoning length. Both model size and test-time compute show diminishing
returns as search space complexity grows beyond a certain complexity. More results are presented in Sec. 3.
Llama-3.1-405B and Llama-3.1-70B demonstrate substan-
tial improvements in accuracy compared to smaller models
such as the 3B and 8B versions. This suggests that scal-
ing up the model size is an effective strategy for enhancing
performance and tackling reasoning tasks in simpler search
spaces. Yet, as the complexity of the search space grows
beyond 106, the advantages of larger model sizes diminish,
and scaling up the model size proves to be less impactful.
This finding underscores the limited utility of model scaling
when dealing with highly complex reasoning tasks, as the
accuracy plateaus regardless of model size.
Model Size Scaling Limitations. This analysis reveals that
scaling up model sizes eventually reaches a point of dimin-
ishing returns in complex search spaces. Beyond a certain
complexity threshold, increasing model parameters is insuf-
ficient to prevent performance decline. This highlights a
critical boundary for current scaling strategies, suggesting
that new approaches are needed to overcome the limitations
imposed by high search space complexity and to advance
reasoning capabilities further.
5. Scaling Test-Time Compute with Repeated
Sampling: Promises & Challenges
We examine the impact of scaling test-time compute, a cru-
cial factor affecting LLM performance on logical reasoning
tasks. Specifically, here we investigate how increasing the
number of candidate samples influences model performance.
We begin by employing Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, where
we repeatedly sample N candidates from the model for each
puzzle. From these candidates, we can select the best an-
swer using various strategies, including majority voting and
existing reward models. To understand the theoretical upper
bound of this approach, we also analyze BoN sampling with
oracle selection, where we use knowledge of the correctanswer to choose the best candidate from the sample pool -
equivalent to the pass@k metric in our evaluation (see the
right-most plot in Fig. 1 and Fig.3).
GPT-4o with Best-of-N sampling and oracle selections
can achieve nearly o1 performance. To understand the
potential improvement of scaling test-time compute for logi-
cal reasoning, we sample 128 candidates from GPT-4o-mini
and GPT-4o and study the coverage of the correct answer in
the sampled candidates. In Table 2, we refer to this coverage
metric as BoN-Oracle , meaning that the best-of-N (BoN)
selection is performed given the oracle knowledge of the
correct answer, i.e., the pass@k metric.
We observe that the BoN-Oracle selection can significantly
improve the performance of GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. For
example, GPT-4o with BoN-Oracle N=128 achieves an over-
all accuracy of 69.1%, which is higher than O1-mini‚Äôs ac-
curacy of 59.7% and a potential scaling effect that can also
outperform O1-preview‚Äôs accuracy of 71.4% if we keep en-
larging the sampling size. Note that on the Medium-size
examples, we can already see a higher accuracy of 92.9%
for BoN-Oracle N=128 compared O1-preview‚Äôs 88.2%, and
the trend shown in the curves indicates that the performance
of GPT-4o can be further improved with more test-time
compute. Fig. 6 in Appendix provides further analysis on
how sampling affects model performance.
Majority Voting is simple yet effective. For majority vot-
ing, we rank the candidates based on the frequency of each
cell in their solution grid, and select the candidate with
the highest sum of frequencies. As for the Reward Model
(RM), we choose the one that ranks to the top on Ai2‚Äôs
RewardBench leaderboard (Lambert et al., 2024b), named
Skywork-Reward-Llama-3.1-8B-v0.2 (Liu et al., 2024). We
find that using Majority V oting for GPT-4o can improve
from 31.7 to 38.0 (for the overall accuracy) when the sam-

ple size N=32, while keep increasing the sample size does
not necessarily improve the performance any more. Also,
the performance of GPT-4o with BoN-RM N=32is 33.9,
which is worse than majority voting, suggesting that the
current reward models that are mainly designed for chat
or general instruction following tasks may not be directly
applicable to (logical) reasoning tasks.
6. Scaling Test-Time Compute with Extensive
Chain-of-Thoughts Tokens
Another approach of scaling test-time compute is to increase
the number of reasoning tokens (i.e., chain-of-thoughts to-
kens) that the model generates during inference.6.1. o1 Generates More Hidden Reasoning Tokens
o1 generates large-scale hidden reasoning tokens. One of
the key differences between o1 and other LLMs is the way
they use more test-time compute to decode much more hid-
den chain-of-thoughts (CoT) tokens during inference time,
which are not directly visible to users. Our analysis shows
that o1 models scale their hidden CoT tokens with puzzle
complexity - producing on average 5,144.6 (o1-mini) and
5,346.3 (o1-preview) hidden reasoning tokens compared to
502.9 and 543.7 for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively.
This order of magnitude difference in reasoning steps ap-
pears to contribute to o1‚Äôs superior performance on logical
reasoning tasks. For detailed analysis of how hidden CoT
tokens vary with puzzle complexity, see Appendix C.3.
Figure 4 reveals a positive correlation between the number
of hidden reasoning tokens generated by o1-preview and
Z3 conflicts, aligning with our earlier observation that o1
allocates more reasoning tokens to more complex puzzles.
For puzzles with fewer than 20 Z3 conflicts, we observe
a consistent ratio of approximately 400 hidden reasoning
tokens per conflict. However, this scaling pattern plateaus
when Z3 conflicts exceed 30, suggesting that o1-preview
may have reached its maximum reasoning capacity at the
current model size. This suggests that while o1-preview
can effectively leverage more reasoning tokens for com-
plex puzzles, there is a limit to the extent to which it can
scale reasoning tokens to address highly complex reasoning
tasks. With the recent release of o1-full, we find that our
previous estimation is consistent with the actual number
of hidden reasoning tokens generated by o1-full, which is
around 5,000 on average. This further confirms the scaling
behavior of o1 models in generating more hidden reasoning
tokens for complex puzzles.
We also find that when o1-preview make mistakes, they
usually generate more hidden reasoning tokens than when
they solve the puzzles correctly, which is consistent with the
observation that o1 tends to generate more reasoning tokens
for more complex puzzles that are harder to solve.
8

ZebraLogic: On the Scaling Limits of LLMs for Logical Reasoning
6.2. Self-Refinement is Limited but Promising
The other feature of o1‚Äôs hidden reasoning process is the
ability to reflect on its own reasoning process and refine
its answer. From our observation on the summary of their
hidden reasoning process, we can see that o1 often revisits
the clues and constraints to verify its previous reasoning
and fix the errors if there are any, which is similar to the
Z3 solver‚Äôs conflict-driven clause learning mechanism. In
order to elicit such self-refinement behavior from LLMs,
we add follow-up queries to ask the model to review its
initial answer and check the clues and constraints again in a
multi-turn conversation setting. There are two settings for
the self-refinement process: one with the oracle knowledge
of the correct answer and the other without the oracle knowl-
edge. Results in Table 2 show modest improvements with
self-verification, particularly without oracle knowledge (4o
improves from 31.7 to 33.0, then decreases to 32.1).
Self-Verification Prompt
Self-Verify: Your answer may be incorrect! Identify
any mistakes in your reasoning and answer, if any.
Correct them to ensure they align with the given
information. Present your updated response in the
same JSON format mentioned in the initial prompt.

‚Ä¢For incorrect results: Your answer is incorrect!
Re-examine the clues, correct the mistakes, and
then provide the revised solution in the original
JSON format.
‚Ä¢For correct results: Your answer is correct.
Please repeat the json-formatted output again.
7. Related Work
Logical Reasoning Benchmarks and Dataset Creation
Logical reasoning has long been a critical area of AI, but
only recently have LLMs been subjected to rigorous testing
in this domain. LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020) emerged early
on to evaluate complex logical comprehension in question-
answering formats; and subsequent efforts by (Liu et al.,
2023) reframed it as a Natural Language Inference (NLI)
task to further stress-test LLMs‚Äô capabilities. Researchers
have also explored generating more dynamic or granular
datasets to push the limits of reasoning systems. For in-
stance, Madusanka et al. (2024) investigated satisfiability
tasks formulated in natural language, studying how vary-
ing computational complexity influences LLM inference
performance. Similarly, Richardson & Sabharwal (2022) in-
troduced a systematic methodology for building challenging
reasoning datasets, exposing robustness gaps in transformer-
based models when tasked with increased complexity. Prior
work on logic grid puzzles include Mitra & Baral (2015)
that proposed a grid-based puzzle dataset prior to the LLM
era and focused on automatic translation from language toa formal specification, Dziri et al. (2023) that investigated
compositionality in LLMs on grid-based puzzles, as well as
Tyagi et al. (2024) that provided a new error taxonomy to
evaluate the correctness of the reasoning chains of LLMs.
Approaches to Logical Reasoning in LLMs. Several
lines of research propose methods to augment or refine
LLMs for stronger logical reasoning. Clark et al. (2020)
demonstrated that transformers can emulate logical reason-
ing over natural language sentences‚Äîserving as ‚Äúsoft the-
orem provers.‚Äù Pan et al. (2024) showed that a decoder-
only Transformer could tackle SAT problems, paralleling
the Davis‚ÄìPutnam‚ÄìLogemann‚ÄìLoveland (DPLL) algorithm,
thereby expanding the role of LLMs to more complex
problem-solving domains. Alternatively, neuro-symbolic
systems like CLOVER (Ryu et al., 2024) integrate LLMs
with symbolic solvers to better capture the translation of
intricate logical semantics from text.
Empirical Evidence of LLM Limitations . Despite these
promising developments, LLMs face persistent hurdles as
logical problem complexity increases. Yan et al. (2024)
contended that models may rely heavily on probabilistic
correlations rather than genuinely understanding logical
rules. Similarly, Xie et al. (2024) highlighted the complex
interplay between training data memorization and genuine
reasoning abilities of LLMs. Additionally, Schlegel et al.
(2022) conducted an extensive empirical study to investi-
gate the detection of formally valid inferences in controlled
fragments of natural language, revealing that transformers
often overfit to superficial patterns rather than acquiring
logical principles. Lam et al. (2024) showed the impact of
the choice of symbolic solvers on the effectiveness of LLMs
in deductive reasoning tasks, calling for more consistent
comparative studies. Further empirical evidence from Dziri
et al. (2023) and Parmar et al. (2024) demonstrated that
even ostensibly simple logical tasks continue to challenge
these models. Finally, Madusanka et al. (2023) investigated
the limits of transformers on solving the problem of model-
checking with natural language and the significant impact of
the language fragment on the performance of transformers.
8. Conclusion
We introduce ZebraLogic , a controlled benchmark of logic
grid puzzles that highlights the scaling limits of LLM-based
reasoning through carefully adjustable complexity. Our ex-
periments reveal a pronounced drop in performance as com-
plexity increases, overshadowing gains from model growth
or training data expansions. While increasing the generation
sample size yields modest improvements, a backtracking-
based approach with expanded reasoning steps significantly
boosts accuracy. These results spotlight the importance of
non-monotonic reasoning and provide a valuable framework
for advancing logical reasoning research.

Based on my research, I now have enough information to create the table. Let me compile the information for each dataset:

1. **BBH (Big-Bench Hard)**: 23 tasks, no training set (evaluation only), no adjustable difficulty
2. **Zebra Logic**: 1 task type (logic grid puzzles), no training set, has adjustable difficulty (multiple complexity levels)
3. **KOR-Bench**: 5 task categories (Operation, Logic, Cipher, Puzzle, Counterfactual), no training set mentioned, no adjustable difficulty
4. **K&K (Knights and Knaves)**: Based on the paper, it's dynamically generated logical reasoning puzzles, has training set (for fine-tuning experiments), has adjustable difficulty
5. **BBEH (BIG-Bench Extra Hard)**: 23 tasks (replaces each BBH task), no training set, no adjustable difficulty

Now let me create the LaTeX table:

Perfect! I've created the LaTeX table and saved it to `/workspace/dumps/workspace/datasets.tex`. Here's a summary of what I found for each dataset:

1. **BBH (Big-Bench Hard)**: 23 challenging tasks selected from BIG-Bench, used only for evaluation (no training set), with fixed difficulty levels.

2. **Zebra Logic**: A single task type (logic grid puzzles/constraint satisfaction problems), evaluation-only dataset with 1,000 puzzles spanning multiple controllable complexity levels based on grid size and logical constraints.

3. **KOR-Bench**: 5 broader task categories (Operation, Logic, Cipher, Puzzle, and Counterfactual reasoning), with 25 rules per category and 10 problems per rule (total 1,250 problems), designed for evaluation without a training set, and without adjustable difficulty levels.

4. **K&K (Knights and Knaves)**: A dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves puzzles. It includes a training set (used for fine-tuning experiments in the paper) and supports adjustable difficulty levels through controlled generation.

5. **BBEH (BIG-Bench Extra Hard)**: 23 tasks (each replacing a corresponding BBH task with increased difficulty), designed as an evaluation benchmark with 200 questions per task, no training set, and fixed difficulty.

The table has been saved with only the table content, no comments, and uses `\ding\{51\}` for checkmarks and `\ding\{55\}` for cross marks as requested.
