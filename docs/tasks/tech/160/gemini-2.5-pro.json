To demonstrate the differences between our work and previous work, I need you to help me summarize a latex table and save it in the workspace with name as `datasets.tex`, the tex file should only contain table content (no commented lines), without any other content. The table needs to include four columns: Dataset (dataset name), Tasks (number of tasks included in the dataset), Trainable (whether it includes a training set, filled with \\ding{55} or \\ding{51}), and Adjustable Difficulty (whether it includes different difficulty levels, filled with \\ding{55} or \\ding{51}). The table format is as follows:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n        \\toprule\n        Dataset & Tasks & Trainable & Adjustable Difficulty\\\\\n        \\midrule\n        % content\n        \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nThe names of the datasets we need to include are (from top to bottom):\n- BBH\n- Zebra Logic\n- KOR-Bench (# of tasks should based the broader categorization in the paper.)\n- K&K (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123)\n- BBEH"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "tool_0_fetch-fetch_txt_710kj2PCWhuJt4tsIyKQ", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "fetch-fetch_txt", "arguments": "{\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Skip to main content We gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and all contributors.

This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate and memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop reasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis based on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles.
