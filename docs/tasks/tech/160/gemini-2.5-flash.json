Recently, my collaborators and I have proposed a logical reasoning dataset and are writing a paper to introduce this new dataset to the community. To demonstrate the differences between our work and previous work, I need you to help me summarize a latex table and save it in the workspace with name as `datasets.tex`, the tex file should only contain table content (no commented lines), without any other content. The table needs to include four columns: Dataset (dataset name), Tasks (number of tasks included in the dataset), Trainable (whether it includes a training set, filled with \\ding{55} or \\ding{51}), and Adjustable Difficulty (whether it includes different difficulty levels, filled with \\ding{55} or \\ding{51}). The table format is as follows:\n\n```tex\n\\begin{table}[!ht]\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n        \\toprule\n        Dataset & Tasks & Trainable & Adjustable Difficulty\\\\\n        \\midrule\n        % content\n        \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nThe names of the datasets we need to include are (from top to bottom):\n- BBH\n- Zebra Logic\n- KOR-Bench (# of tasks should based the broader categorization in the paper.)\n- K&K (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123)\n- BBEH"
