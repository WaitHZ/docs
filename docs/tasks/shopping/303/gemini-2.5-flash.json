The product must be taken off the shelf (set to draft or private status, or with catalog visibility set to hidden), rather than deleted. Given a product model, search for historical orders related to that product and send a recall email to the corresponding customer's email address. See `recall_email_template.md` for the email template. The email must include a Google Forms recall form created using the `recall_form_template.json` template, and return the form information in `recall_report.json`. The template is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n\"form_id\": \"Google Forms form ID\",\n\n\"form_url\": \"Google Forms form link\",\n}\n```"
