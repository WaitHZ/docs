Deduct the corresponding quantities from the raw material inventory table in Google Sheets, write the updated raw material inventory back to Google Sheets, and then, based on the updated raw material balances, recalculate the maximum producible quantities for all finished products. Finally, sync these maximum producible quantities to WooCommerce as the available stock for the products."
