Save the following data with headers being `Region`, `Top5_Countries`, `Top5_GDP_Sum`, `Region_GDP_Total`, and `CR5_Ratio`, where they represent the region name, the top five countries (use exactly the full names in existing sheet and separated by \"/\", from highest to lowest), the sum of the top five countries' GDP, the total regional GDP, and the CR5 index (percentage, rounded to two decimal places). Sort the data in descending order by CR5 index. \n\nNote: You should strictly following the country classification provided by the World Bank. If one region has less than 5 countries, you just consider the real number of countries in filling the table."
