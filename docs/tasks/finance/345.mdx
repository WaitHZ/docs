Perfect! I have successfully completed the analysis of NVIDIA's ownership and market trends by populating the Excel template with the required data. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Analysis Summary

### 1. Basic Trend Sheet (Historical Quarterly Data)
- **2024Q3**: Stock price $121.41, Outstanding shares 24,508M, Market cap $2,975.55B
- **2024Q4**: Stock price $134.26, Outstanding shares 24,477M, Market cap $3,285.21B  
- **2025Q1**: Stock price $108.37, Outstanding shares 24,387.56M, Market cap $2,642.86B
- **2025Q2**: Stock price $157.98, Outstanding shares 24,347M, Market cap $3,847.04B

### 2. Major Holders Summary
- **Insiders Held Percentage**: 4.33%
- **Institutions Held Percentage**: 68.98%
- **Number of Institutions**: 6,788

### 3. Key Shareholders Details (Top 10 Institutional Holders)
1. **Vanguard Group Inc**: 2,232.44M shares, $394.41B value, 9.19% holding, +1.8% change
2. **Blackrock Inc.**: 1,909.79M shares, $337.40B value, 7.86% holding, +0.42% change
3. **FMR, LLC**: 997.98M shares, $176.31B value, 4.11% holding, -0.39% change
4. **State Street Corporation**: 978.21M shares, $172.82B value, 4.03% holding, +0.99% change
5. **Geode Capital Management, LLC**: 579.21M shares, $102.33B value, 2.38% holding, +1.49% change

And 5 additional major institutional holders with their respective holdings and percentage changes.

- Strong institutional ownership at nearly 69% indicates high institutional confidence
- The top 5 institutional holders control approximately 28% of the company
