## Instruction

You are an investment analysis assistant. Please use Yahoo Finance to perform financial analysis. Create three separate spreadsheets(Note that these are not three sheets in one file) in the designated folder of Google Sheets with the spreadsheet names the same as the sheet names in the excel file `results.xlsx`. Note that I have filled some contents in the excel, for these parts you much copy them without any change and you just need to fill in the rest cells. Please keep 2 decimals for all floating numbers. Cumulative value assumes $10,000 invested at 2020 year-end. Do not include % mark in the cells as we already write in the headers.

- NVDA: 931.26% cumulative return, 79.20% CAGR
- AAPL: 93.00% cumulative return, 17.87% CAGR
- $10,000 invested in NVDA at 2020 year-end → **$103,125.87** by 2024
- $10,000 invested in AAPL at 2020 year-end → **$19,299.96** by 2024

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- NVDA showed explosive revenue growth: 114.20% in 2024 (AI boom)
- AAPL showed steady growth: 2.02% in 2024
- Current P/E: NVDA 52.20, AAPL 38.34

Based on my review of the three Google Sheets, I can see that the task has been successfully completed. Let me provide a summary of what has been accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully created three separate Google Sheets in the designated folder with the following details:

### 1. Investment Return Comparison
- **Spreadsheet ID**: 1URJO43zrJtA6nJ53P9qn94bTStivnlC4rhU-KfJ8W0Y
- **Data**: Contains year-end prices, annual returns, and cumulative values for NVDA and AAPL from 2021-2024
- **Status**: Complete with all data populated

### 2. Fundamental Analysis  
- **Spreadsheet ID**: 1kobmmy3ZBDPb2W5gotHX2Srwuf4xg5fdydaSn1akBcA
- **Data**: Contains annual revenue, P/E ratios, and revenue growth rates for NVDA and AAPL from 2022-2024
- **Status**: Complete with all data populated

### 3. Investment Decision Reference
- **Spreadsheet ID**: 1uT5o07Yq68mXrREkXiC7DZHYYS_j4TRUbbDPkUratHc
- **Data**: Contains key investment metrics including cumulative returns, annualized returns, P/E ratios, analyst target prices, and upside potential
- **Status**: Complete with all data populated

### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ Three separate spreadsheets (not sheets in one file)
- ✅ Spreadsheet names match the original Excel file requirements
- ✅ All floating numbers kept to 2 decimal places as requested
- ✅ No % marks in cells (already included in headers)
- ✅ Cumulative values calculated assuming $10,000 invested at 2020 year-end
- ✅ All existing content from the Excel file preserved and copied without changes
- ✅ Missing cells filled with appropriate financial data

The task has been fully completed according to the original requirements. All three Google Sheets are now available in the designated Google Drive folder with comprehensive financial analysis data for NVDA and AAPL stocks.
