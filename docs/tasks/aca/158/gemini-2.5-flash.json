Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned to learn to decom-\\npose a target task. This finetuning requires target task demonstrations segmented\\ninto sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic rules. However, the heuris-\\ntic subtasks can deviate significantly from the training data of the visuomotor\\npolicy, which degrades task performance. To address these issues, we propose a\\nRetrieval-basedDemonstrationDecomposer (RDD) that automatically decomposes\\ndemonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning the visual features of the decomposed\\nsub-task intervals with those from the training data of the low-level visuomotor\\npolicies.

Traditional robotic\\nprogramming and learning methods often struggle with the variability and complexity inherent in real-\\nworld scenarios. Building upon the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language\\nModels (LLMs), a new class of multi-modal foundation models known as Vision-Language-Action\\nmodels (VLAs) [ 1,2,3,4,5] has emerged specifically for embodied AI applications. As recent\\nstudies [ 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13] have shown, integrating high-level planners above the low-level\\nvisuomotor policies vastly improves the performance for long-horizon robotic tasks. This has led\\nto the hierarchical VLA paradigm [ 14,15,13,16,17,18,19,20]. The planner, often a powerful\\nVLM, performs task planning and reasoning to break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks\\nwith step-by-step language instructions. A learning-based visuomotor policy, trained on datasets with\\nshort-horizon sub-tasks and conditioned on the generated sub-task instructions, performs precise\\nmanipulation to complete the sub-tasks one by one, thereby completing long-horizon tasks.\\nDespite its versatility, a vanilla VLM planner typically needs to be finetuned with human demon-\\nstrations when deploying to a given task [ 18,14,16]. To build the dataset for planner finetuning,\\ndemonstrations are temporally decomposed to sub-tasks by human annotation [ 14,16,18,19,15] or\\nheuristics [ 13,15,21,22,23,24,25]. However, these methods are neither scalable nor efficient, and,\\nmost importantly, they could generate sub-tasks that deviate significantly from the training data of\\nthe low-level visuomotor policy. Figure 1 illustrates this dilemma.

Edge devices are limited in computing power and\\nmemory, making model efficiency and compression essential.\\nIn this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement\\nlearning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an\\nefficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the\\ndetector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset collected\\nin diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in real-\\nworld navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing\\nmodule, extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input,\\nwhich are then passed to an RL policy to control goal-oriented\\nnavigation. Experimental results show that the student model\\nachieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy\\nper inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and\\nRaspberry Pi 5, while keeping the same performance as the\\nteacher model. EdgeNavMamba also maintains high detection\\naccuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while reducing\\nparameters by 31% compared to the baseline.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nEdge deployment is a key challenge for practical Deep\\nLearning (DL) applications [1], [2], particularly in autonomous\\nnavigation, medical imaging , which require real-time per-\\nformance [3]\u2013[8]. DL models on edge devices must be\\nlightweight and efficient to provide real-time, reliable per-\\nformance despite constraints in computation and power [9]\u2013\\n[11]. Particularly in autonomous navigation (Fig. 1), scene\\nunderstanding is critical, enabling vision models to learn envi-\\nronmental features, obstacles, and paths for navigation in both\\nnew and familiar scenarios [12], [13]. Deploying these models\\non edge devices is challenging due to their computational\\nintensity, which is necessary for high accuracy [14].\\nOptimization methods have been applied to these models\\nto improve power and memory efficiency. Since You Only\\nLook Once (YOLO) [15] revolutionized object detection by\\nusing regression on bounding boxes, several efforts have\\napplied these methods to YOLO. YOLO-ACE redesigned the\\nbackbone and applied double distillation [12], and Mamba\\nYOLO [16] integrated a state-space-model (SSM) [17] back-\\nbone for efficiency. With the introduction of these lightweight\\nyet powerful models, the deployment of edge devices for\\nnavigation tasks becomes more feasible and efficient. For the\\nnavigation phase, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been a\\nsuccessful inspiration, as it allows the agent to learn through\\ninteractions and real-time feedback [18]. However, to the best\\nof our knowledge no existing work has attempted to combine\\n(b) Rosmaster Edge Platforms :     (a) Go2 Robot Dog \\nEdge Accelerator : \\nJetson Orin Nano Computing Power: 40 TOPs \\nCPU: Six-core Cortex A78AE ARMv8.2 | 2x clusters \\n(1x 4-core cluster + 128 KB L1 + 256KB L2 per core + 2MB  \\nL3) + 1x 2-core cluster (128 KB L1 + 256KB L2 per core +  \\n2MB L3) | System Cache: 4 MB (shared across all clusters) \\nMemory: 8GB 128-bit LPDDR5 DRAM \\nPower Mode: 7W | 15W \\nComputing Power: 40 TOPs \\nMemory: 8GB DRAM \\nPower Mode: 7W | 15W Fig. 1.

Unlike prior lightweight YOLO variants or state-\\nspace backbones, our design uniquely integrates the Mamba\\narchitecture with KD [21] to achieve a balance between ac-\\ncuracy, and energy efficiency. The combination of state-space\\nmodeling and distillation enables compact yet context-aware\\nfeature representations that YOLO variants cannot capture.\\nThis framework directly addresses the memory and compu-\\ntational bottlenecks of edge deployment while maintaining\\nreal-time performance.

Metabolomics presents unique chal-\\nlenges with its complex biochemical pathways,\\nheterogeneous identifier systems, and frag-\\nmented databases. To systematically evalu-\\nate LLM capabilities in this domain, we in-\\ntroduceMetaBench, the first benchmark for\\nmetabolomics assessment. Curated from au-\\nthoritative public resources, MetaBench evalu-\\nates five capabilities essential for metabolomics\\nresearch:knowledge,understanding,ground-\\ning,reasoning, andresearch. Our evalua-\\ntion of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs\\nreveals distinct performance patterns across\\nmetabolomics tasks: while models perform\\nwell on text generation tasks, cross-database\\nidentifier grounding remains challenging even\\nwith retrieval augmentation. Model perfor-\\nmance also decreases on long-tail metabolites\\nwith sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we\\nprovide essential infrastructure for developing\\nand evaluating metabolomics AI systems, en-\\nabling systematic progress toward reliable com-\\nputational tools for metabolomics research.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are being rapidly\\nadopted across metabolomics research, driven by\\ntheir demonstrated success in adjacent biomedi-\\ncal domains (Liu et al., 2025; Bekbergenova et al.,\\n2025). Biomedical LLMs have transformed protein\\nstructure prediction, clinically assist with diagno-\\nsis and treatment planning, and chemistry-focused\\nsystems support reaction prediction and molecular\\ndesign (Wang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Hu and\\nLu, 2024). Research groups now routinely utilize\\nLLMs for tasks ranging from analyzing experiment\\nresults to generating study proposals. However,this rapid adoption has outpaced systematic evalu-\\nation: we lack a comprehensive understanding of\\nwhich metabolomics tasks LLMs can reliably per-\\nform, where they fail, and why. This evaluation gap\\nposes significant risks for a field where incorrect\\nmetabolite assignments or pathway interpretations\\ncan propagate through analysis pipelines and lead\\nto false biological conclusions.\\nThe consequences of deploying LLMs without\\nproper evaluation extend beyond individual re-\\nsearch errors. Metabolomics research demands\\ncapabilities that differ fundamentally from gen-\\neral text understanding and generation (Bifarin\\net al., 2025). Researchers must integrate informa-\\ntion across specialized databases such as the Hu-\\nman Metabolome Database (HMDB) and the Ky-\\noto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)\\n(Wishart et al., 2022; Kanehisa et al., 2025), each\\nemploying distinct identifier systems and ontolo-\\ngies. Without knowing which of the capabilities\\ncurrent LLMs possess, researchers cannot make\\ninformed decisions about where to deploy these\\ntools, what verification procedures to implement,\\nor how to interpret AI-assisted results.\\nCurrent biomedical evaluation frameworks can-\\nnot answer these questions (Chen et al., 2025;\\nKrithara et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2019). These bench-\\nmarks evaluate capabilities in natural language un-\\nderstanding but do not measure the specialized op-\\nerations that metabolomics requires. For example,\\nhigh performance on MedQA provides no evidence\\nfor reliability on identifier grounding, and failure\\non BioASQ does not preclude success on pathway\\ndescription generation. Without evaluation frame-\\nworks designed for metabolomics-specific tasks,\\nthe field lacks criteria for model selection, failure\\nmode identification, or systematic improvement.\\nIn this paper, we presentMetaBench, a com-\\nprehensive benchmark designed to systematically\\nassess LLM capabilities across metabolomics tasks.\\nMetaBench evaluates five capability levels essen-\\n1arXiv:2510.14944v1  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2025\",\"annotations\":null}",
