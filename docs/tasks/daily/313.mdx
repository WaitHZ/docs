## Instruction

I (Andrew) and six friends (Lau, Chen, Diana, Elena, Frank, and Grace) traveled to Turkey during 2025. We all exchanged currencies on June 5th before the trip. Please help me read all the files in the personal workspace, and calculate the total trip cost for all seven of us in CNY (please calculate with the exchange rate we actually used, you can find exchange rates on yahoo).

Fill the specified file `calculation.json` in the workspace.

Great! Now I have all the exchange rates. Let me calculate the TRY to CNY rate using the TRY to USD rate and USD to CNY rate:

- USD to CNY: 7.203700065612793
- EUR to CNY: 8.174271583557129
- TRY to USD: 0.025468362495303154
- TRY to CNY: 0.025468362495303154 × 7.203700065612793 = 0.18348
- SGD to CNY: 5.576481819152832

Now let me calculate each person's expenses by parsing their data and converting to CNY. Let me create a Python script to handle all the calculations:

Excellent! I have successfully calculated the total trip cost for all seven travelers to Turkey. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## Summary

I read all the expense files and memory notes for Andrew and his six friends (Lau, Chen, Diana, Elena, Frank, and Grace) who traveled to Turkey in 2025. Using the exchange rates from June 5th, 2025 (when they exchanged currencies), I calculated the total trip cost.

### Exchange Rates Used (June 5, 2025):
- **USD to CNY**: 7.2037
- **EUR to CNY**: 8.1743
- **TRY to CNY**: 0.1835 (calculated via TRY→USD→CNY)
- **SGD to CNY**: 5.5765

### Individual Expenses (in CNY):
1. **Andrew**: 13,068.78 CNY
2. **Lau**: 23,107.49 CNY  
3. **Chen**: 7,328.14 CNY
4. **Diana**: 18,510.11 CNY
5. **Elena**: 8,103.64 CNY
6. **Frank**: 10,107.74 CNY
7. **Grace**: 13,149.58 CNY

### **Total Trip Cost: 93,375.48 CNY**

The calculation includes:
- All expenses from the CSV files (flights, hotels, meals, activities, transportation, shopping, etc.)
- Additional expenses mentioned in the memory files (tips, small purchases, spontaneous activities)
- Proper currency conversion using the actual exchange rates from June 5th, 2025

The `calculation.json` file has been successfully updated with all the detailed calculations and the final total cost.

I have read all the expense files and calculated the total trip cost.
I found the exchange rates for USD to CNY and EUR to CNY on June 5th, 2025, using the `yahoo_finance` tool.
However, I was unable to find a direct exchange rate for TRY to CNY for the specified date. As a fallback, I have used an approximate rate of 0.22, and I have noted this in the final output.

Here is the breakdown of the total cost:
*   **Exchange Rates on 2025-06-05:**
    *   1 USD = 7.175 CNY
    *   1 EUR = 8.2177 CNY
    *   1 TRY ≈ 0.22 CNY (approximate)

*   **Individual Costs (in CNY):**
    *   Andrew: 13706.57
    *   Lau: 18480.1
    *   Chen: 7334.69
    *   Diana: 16974.72
    *   Elena: 7759.36
    *   Frank: 12393.54
    *   Grace: 11570.46

*   **Total Trip Cost (in CNY):** 88219.44

I have saved the detailed calculation in the `calculation.json` file in the workspace.
