A few days ago, I saw the introduction to UPenn's famous sights in the recommendation.md file (located in the workspace) and was very impressed. Please help me plan the shortest walking route and provide the visiting order. I want to visit all the attractions described in recommendation.md (you must list each individual attraction separately, even if they are very close to each other). Please save the final route plan to a file named upenn_route_plan.json, using the format from format.json in the workspace. We only consider the time spent walking between attractions and not the time spent staying at the attractions."

ENIAC: The World's First General-Purpose Electronic Computer**\\n\\nPenn is the birthplace of the modern computer, and the **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) is the representative of this revolutionary invention. It was designed and built by Penn's John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert during World War II and was unveiled in 1946. This \\\"giant brain\\\" was initially intended to calculate ballistic trajectories for the U.S. Army. Its scale was immense, covering about 1,800 square feet, weighing 30 tons, and using 17,468 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, and 10,000 capacitors. While the entire machine was later disassembled and moved elsewhere, the Penn School of Engineering still displays some original **ENIAC** panels to commemorate this extraordinary achievement. Visitors can get a glimpse into the dawn of the computer age through these exhibits and feel the weight of technological history.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Penn Museum**\\n\\nThe **Penn Museum**, officially known as the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, is one of the world's leading archaeological museums. Its collection of over a million artifacts covers items from major civilizations across the globe. Featured exhibits include a monumental Sphinx from ancient Egypt (one of the largest outside of Egypt), mosaics from ancient Rome, the Chinese bas-reliefs of the Six Horses of Zhaoling, and precious artifacts from Mesopotamia and the Americas. The museum building itself is a work of art, blending Italian Renaissance and Victorian Gothic styles with a distinctive dome and courtyard. It serves not only as a hub for academic research but also as a vital window for the public to view human history and cultural heritage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Benjamin Franklin Statue**\\n\\nThis statue stands directly in front of **College Hall**, the oldest building on campus, and is an iconic landmark of the University of Pennsylvania. The figure is none other than **Benjamin Franklin**, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the founder of the school. He was not only a distinguished statesman and scientist but also an educator who founded what would become America's first university. The statue is solemn and dignified, symbolizing the spirit that Penn upholds in the fields of education, science, and public service. Many students and visitors choose to take photos here to show respect for this great man. It is also a key gathering point in the heart of the campus, bearing witness to the growth of generations of Penn students.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Fisher Fine Arts Library**\\n\\nEven if you are not an art or architecture major, this library is well worth a visit. It is a Victorian Gothic building designed by the famous architect **Frank Furness**. The interior space is full of historical grandeur, with its massive reading room and intricate staircases providing excellent spots for photos.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. College Hall**\\n\\nAs the oldest building on campus, **College Hall** is a testament to the history of **Upenn**. It is a beautiful Victorian Gothic building, and the statue of the school's founder, **Benjamin Franklin**, stands right at its entrance.\",\"annotations\":null}",
