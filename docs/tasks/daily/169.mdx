## Instruction

I am staying at the Singapore Mobility Gallery and would like to travel to Changi Airport MRT station. I prefer not to use any mode of transport other than the MRT. Please design a route with the shortest walking distance. Finally, please save all the stations (including the ones passed along the way) in sequential order to a file named routine.txt, with one station per line.

It runs from Bukit Panjang station in the north-west of the country towards Expo station in the east via a loop around the city-centre. Coloured blue on the rail map, the line serves 35 stations, all of which are underground.[2] The DTL is the fifth MRT line on the network to be opened and the third line to be entirely underground. It is the second MRT line to be operated by ComfortDelGro's SBS Transit after the North East Line. It also serves as an alternative to the East–West Line where it runs roughly geographically parallel from Bugis to Expo station. Originally planned as three separate lines, the lines merged into the Downtown Line in 2007 and construction began in three stages. Stage 1, from Bugis to Chinatown stations[a] opened in 2013, followed by Stage 2 from Bukit Panjang to Rochor stations[b] opening in 2015. The third and final stage, from Fort Canning to Expo stations,[c] opened in 2017. At 41.9 kilometres (26.0 mi), the DTL is the longest underground and automated rapid transit line in Singapore.[1] It utilises the Bombardier Movia C951 electric multiple unit (EMU) and runs in a three-car formation, and is Singapore's second medium-capacity rail line after the Circle Line. The line is set to have new stations and extensions in the 2020s and 2030s. An infill station initially constructed as part of Stage 2, Hume, began operations in February 2025.[5] Stage 3e, a two-station extension consisting of Xilin and Sungei Bedok, is under construction and is scheduled to begin operations from the second half of 2026.[6] By 2H 2026, it will be about 45 kilometres (28 mi) long with 37 stations, and will serve more than half a million commuters daily.[7] A two-station extension to connect with the North–South Line at Sungei Kadut is also being planned and set to open in 2035.[8] History[edit] Background and inception[edit] At the official opening of the Dover station on 23 October 2001, then-Minister for Communications and Information Technology Yeo Cheow Tong announced three MRT lines, two of which―the Bukit Timah Line and the northern part of the Eastern Region Line―are part of today's DTL. The Bukit Timah Line aimed to alleviate the traffic problems along the Bukit Timah and Dunearn Road corridor, and provide a direct link to the city area for residents in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang. The proposed Eastern Region Line, slated to be a loop in the eastern regions, aimed to relieve the passenger load on the often-congested East–West Line and benefiting those living in Tampines, Bedok and Marine Parade.[9]: 16―17 [10][11] On 14 June 2005, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced the Downtown Extension (renamed to "Downtown Line Stage 1"), which would serve the New Downtown at Marina Bay area, where an integrated resort (Marina Bay Sands) and Singapore's second botanical garden (Gardens by the Bay) were to be located. The 3.4-kilometre (2.1-mile) extension, estimated to cost S$1.4 billion, was initially announced to be part of the Circle Line.[12] On 27 April 2007, then Transport Minister Raymond Lim announced that the Downtown Line would be built in three stages stretching 40 kilometres (25 miles) with 33 stations.[13][14][15][16] Construction and opening[edit] The construction of DTL tunnels near Clarke Quay. The diversion of the Singapore River for construction works for the tunnels between the Chinatown and Fort Canning stations was considered an engineering feat at the time.[17][18][19] A separate entrance for the DTL platforms for Tampines MRT station, which is not directly connected to the EWL platforms of the station. The line was built in 3 stages: Stage 1 of the Downtown Line, stretching 4.3-kilometre (2.7 mi), started construction in January 2008 at Chinatown station,[9]: 30 where platform provisions were built to facilitate an interchange station during the construction of the North East Line. It began service on 22 December 2013,[20] with its official inauguration made on the day before by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.[21] Stage 2, first conceptualized and announced as the Bukit Timah line on 23 October 2001, is 16.6 kilometres (10.3 mi) long with 12 stations connecting Bukit Panjang and Rochor stations, including four interchange stations. Construction for Stage 2 began on 3 July 2009 with a groundbreaking ceremony at Beauty World station.[22][23] The line inaugurated on 27 December 2015, with free travel for all 18 stations from 27 December 2015 to 1 January 2016.[24][25][26] Stage 3 goes from Chinatown to Expo. The station locations and finalised route were unveiled on 20 August 2010.[27][28] Stage 3 of the Downtown Line is 21 kilometres (13 mi) long and serve 16 stations.[1][29] The route opened on 21 October 2017,[30] with free travel for all DTL stations on the first two days of the line completion.[31][32] The line, with an estimated cost of S$12 billion, was considered the government's most ambitious rail project. The cost exceeded those of the Circle Line (at $6.7 billion) and the North East Line (at $4.6 billion). Final costs of building the line may reach an estimated about S$20.7 billion, up more than 70% from the initial estimation, due to sharp rises in construction costs and a number of changes in plans.[33][9]: 19 In October 2014, it was announced that Stage 2's opening would be pushed back to the first quarter of 2016. This was because one of the main contractors for the DTL2, Alpine Bau (which was building King Albert Park, Sixth Avenue and Tan Kah Kee), went bankrupt in mid-2013.[34] On 28 June 2015, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew announced that the delay was "completely resolved" by the authorities and Stage 2's opening date was brought forward to 27 December 2015.[35][36] The DTL 3 started operations on 21 October 2017, officially opened by Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.[37][38][39] To serve the line, the Gali Batu Depot was opened in December 2015 to stable 42 trains. It is situated at part of the former Kwong Hou Sua Teochew Cemetery off Woodlands Road.[40] Also in February that year, the Land Transport Authority announced that the capacity of the depot will be expanded to stable 81 trains by 2019.[41] On 7 March 2019, Hume station was announced to be opened by the second quarter of 2025 to better serve Hillview residents.[5][42] The station was opened on 28 February 2025, ahead of the original timeline. Future[edit] On 17 January 2013, plans were announced for a southern extension extending from Expo to connect with the Eastern Region Line (ERL); the ERL has since been subsumed into the Thomson–East Coast Line. The extension was to provide more travel options and enhance connectivity for the residents along the East Coast.[43][44] The Downtown Line 3 extension (DTL3e) was finalised and announced on 15 August 2014, in conjunction with the announcement of the Thomson–East Coast Line.[45] Two stations, Xilin MRT station and Sungei Bedok MRT station, will be added to the Downtown Line, with Sungei Bedok as an interchange station with the Thomson–East Coast Line. It will lengthen the line by 2.2 km (1.4 mi).[45] Expected to be completed in the second half of 2026, Stage 3e will connect the current East–West Line at Expo station and the future TEL at Sungei Bedok station.[46] An additional extension to the Downtown Line to Sungei Kadut station from Bukit Panjang station was announced on 25 May 2019 by the LTA. The extension is set to cut down travel time to the downtown area by up to 30 minutes for those living in the northwestern area of Singapore. The extension is expected to be completed by the mid-2030s. A study will also be conducted to determine the stops to be added between the Sungei Kadut and the existing Bukit Panjang stations.[8] On 6 December 2024, it was announced that Stage 3e will commence operation in the second half of 2026.[47] On 6 January 2025, a 4 km (2.5 mi) extension to the future Sungei Kadut station was announced, including an additional unnamed station between Sungei Kadut station and Bukit Panjang station, slated to begin operation in 2035.[48][49] Notable incidents[edit] A fire occurred on a maintenance locomotive which was carrying out works at Mattar station on 24 May 2024 at around 1:00 am. This resulted in the section between Fort Canning and Mattar stations to be closed as the locomotive could not be moved until heat from its body dissipated. The fire was put out by SCDF and one staff member was conveyed to the hospital for smoke inhalation. Train services at the affected MRT stations resumed at 7:26 am after more than an hour since the start of train service.[50] Network and operations[edit] Route[edit] Geographically accurate map of the Downtown Line.[51] The Downtown Line generally goes in an east–west direction from Bukit Panjang in the northwestern side of Singapore, through the downtown area of Singapore, to Tampines and the Singapore Expo in the east. It is 41.9 kilometres (26.0 mi) long and is entirely underground. Before Bukit Panjang station, there exists a brief northwards extension to the line's depot Gali Batu Depot. The line begins at the Bukit Panjang station and then goes in the southeast direction, running parallel to Upper Bukit Timah Road and along the Bukit Timah Canal through Bukit Timah. The line then enters the central area, passing through Little India station before reaching the Central Business District via Bugis station. The Downtown Line runs parallel to the Circle Line at the Promenade and Bayfront stations. Passing through the Downtown Core, the line interchanges with the North East Line at Chinatown station. After Chinatown station, the line goes in a northeast direction and under the Singapore River. Between the Bencoolen and Jalan Besar stations, the line intersects itself, the first MRT line to do so. After Geylang Bahru station, the line continues in a general eastwards direction, through the industrial areas of Kampong Ubi and Kaki Bukit (briefly paralleling Ubi Avenue 2 and Kaki Bukit Avenue 1), before continuing towards the Tampines Regional Centre and goes southwards, ending at Changi Business Park. The DTL3 extension (DTL3e) from Expo station will extend the line further towards the Thomson–East Coast Line at Sungei Bedok station.[52] Stations[edit] Station codes for the line are blue, corresponding to the line's colour on the system map.

As of 2011[update], the Downtown Line has one type of rolling stock, the Bombardier MOVIA C951(A) cars,[56] running in a three-car formation. They have been stabled at Gali Batu Depot since it opened with Stage 2 of the downtown line on 27 December 2015. For the period between the opening of Stage 1 and that of Stage 2, trains were stabled at a maintenance facility that was built at Marina Bay as part of the Circle Line project. Kim Chuan Depot housed the Operations Control Centre for the Downtown Line Stage 1 until Gali Batu Depot was ready.[57] On 12 October 2012, the first of 11 trains for the line arrived at Jurong Port. It was transported to Kim Chuan Depot to undergo testing by the LTA before it was handed over to SBS Transit.[58] As of 28 February 2013[update], Bombardier had delivered five of the 11 trains for Downtown Line stage 1.[59] LTA together with the operator, SBS Transit, conducted the necessary tests to ensure safety standards, functional performance and systems compatibility requirements were met before revenue service began on 22 December 2013.[60] Testing for Stage 2 began on 25 October 2015 and rolling stock that was delivered to Gali Batu Depot commenced service in Stage 1 on 21 October 2015, while SBS Transit slowly moved the equipment managing the DTL trains to Gali Batu Depot during non-revenue hours.[9] Kim Chuan Depot, together with the adjacent Tai Seng Facility Building, operated in a minor capacity until Stage 3 opened. A new depot, named the East Coast Integrated Depot, is planned to provide additional stabling capacity to the line in the second half of 2026.[61] Testing on the integration of systems of Stage 3 and the rest of the line started from 14 May 2017 till 27 August 2017.[62] Train control[edit] The Downtown Line is equipped with Siemens (previously Invensys before Siemens acquisition) Trainguard Sirius Communications-based train control (CBTC) moving block signalling system with Automatic train control (ATC) under Automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 4 (UTO).[63] The subsystems consist of Automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Controlguide Rail 9000 Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and Trackguard Westrace MK2 Computer-based interlocking (CBI) system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.[64][65] A fall-back signalling system, relying on conventional track-circuit occupancy detection, is included to ensure fully automatic operation and train protection independent of the radio system. Platform screen doors (PSDs) along the line were installed by Westinghouse Signal (Invensys Rail Group), supplied by Faiveley.[66] The PSDs provide safety for passengers, offering protection from arriving and departing trains.[67][68] Notes[edit] ^ Formerly the Downtown Extension of the Circle Line. ^ Formerly the Bukit Timah Line. ^ Formerly the northern stretch of the Eastern Region Line. ^ DTL2 Contract 912 ^ DTL2 Contract 913 ^ S$225.2 for DTL2 Contract 915, S$34.338 million for Contract 915A for completion works ^ DTL2 Contract 916 ^ S$320.7 million for DTL2 Contract 917, S$254 million for DTL2 Contract 917A for completion of works after insolvency of first contractor ^ S$350 million for DTL2 Contract 918, S$222 million for DTL2 Contract 918A for completion of works after insolvency of first contractor ^ DTL2 Contract 919 ^ DTL2 Contract 920 ^ DTL2 Contract 921 ^ DTL1 Contract 903 ^ DTL1 Contract 902 ^ DTL1 Contract 906 ^ DTL1 Contract 907 ^ DTL1 Contract 908 ^ DTL1 Contract 909 ^ DTL3 Contract 937 ^ DTL3 Contract 936 ^ DTL3 Contract 935 ^ DTL3 Contract 933 ^ DTL3 Contract 932A ^ DTL3 Contract 932 ^ DTL3 Contract 931 ^ DTL3 Contract 930 ^ DTL3 Contract 929 ^ S$268.68 million for DTL3 Contract 928 for Bedok North station, S$211.7 million for DTL3 Contract C929A for reception tunnels to Tai Seng Facility Building ^ DTL3 Contract 927 ^ DTL3 Contract 926 ^ DTL3 Contract 925A ^ DTL3 Contract 925 ^ DTL3 Contract 923 ^ DTL3 Contract 922 ^ DTL3e Contract T313 ^ Contract T312; cost shared with Thomson–East Coast Line References[edit] ^ a b c d e "Projects – Downtown Line – Stages".
