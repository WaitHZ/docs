## Instruction

My good friend Alex and I both want to attend the Freshmen Welcome Party and participate for the whole day. Please help me fill out the questionnaire for both of us based on the content in my memory. Anything not mentioned in the memory should be defaulted to negative. You can find the form link in `form_link_for_public.txt` in the workspace. For replies with the same name, only the last one will be considered as the official submission.
