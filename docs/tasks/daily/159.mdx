## Instruction

I want to go on a vacation to Paris soon. Please help me create a two-day Paris travel itinerary based on the list of attractions in 'my_wishlist.txt'. My trip starts on July 28, 2025. I plan to start from Notre Dame Cathedral. On the first day, I will mainly focus on the eastern and southern areas of Paris, and on the second day, I will mainly focus on the western and central areas. Please help me plan the itinerary with a reasonable path for both days, save it as 'Paris_Itinerary.json', and strictly follow the format in 'format.json'.(If you reach the destination, "distance_to_next" is recorded as null, and opening hour is filled in with the opening hours of the day.)

I did it and it's a great experience!\n\nIt is a must, if you are visiting Paris. Definitely, don't skip this of your list.",

Free to enter, long queue but moved quickly and only took about 20 minutes to get inside.  There was a mass taking place when we visited so it was very busy inside but it was lovely to hear the organ music and singing showcasing the wonderful acoustics.  I would recommend timing your visit to coincidence with a service as this is an experience not to be missed.  The artwork and stained glass are exquisite and you have a real sense of history as you walk round this remarkable building which had played such an central part in the story of the French nation.",

What makes it even more special is that you can view it from different spots in the city, and each view feels unique.\n\nGoing up to the summit was an unforgettable experience—the panoramic view of Paris from the top left me speechless. Seeing the city’s lights stretch endlessly was both romantic and deeply emotional, making me feel grateful and so alive in that moment.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is not just a structure; it’s a symbol of love, elegance, and brilliance. My heart was filled with happiness during my visit, and the memory will stay with me forever. ❤️",

It would take days to go through it all, so I'd sincerely suggest a guide to maximize your time viewing the impressive collection.  If you can, plan your visit before or after summer, and avoid holidays.  I'd also suggest viewing the more iconic items close to closing time.  The crowds thin out and you'll have a better viewing experience.  Otherwise, try hard to be in the first group to enter and quickly go to the more popular items as quickly as possible.  Either way, have a plan.  Visit the museum's website and know what you want to see and where you need to go.  Absolutely buy tickets ahead of time.  There's stairs, escalators, lifts, and ramps to transit.  We walked 3 miles in just over 2 hours, so expect to walk - a lot.",

Truly Iconic.\n\nMake sure you book early ahead of time.\n\nThe moment you walk through its grand entrance, you’re surrounded by centuries of masterpieces – from the Notorious Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo to Egyptian mummies and royal French artifacts.\n\nLHOOQ Mona Lisa try to say it in French real quick.\n\nThe museum itself is a work of art, with its elegant palace architecture and the striking glass pyramid in the courtyard.\n\nIt’s massive!! you could spend days exploring and still discover new rooms. My tip: plan your visit, wear comfortable shoes, and focus on a few sections you’re most interested in to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWhether you’re an art lover or just a curious traveler, the Louvre is an unmissable Paris experience. Every hallway tells a story, you would learn more if you had the tour guide explaining the history. Every priceless piece connects you to a moment in history.\n\nThe Visit, a walkthrough a thousand years of history, made us appreciate the evolution and intelligence of humankind.",

The building and art are overwhelming and you could spend days inside here.\n\nHowever, over crowding is detracting from the experience. It is packed - lines for the toilets, Mona Lisa is 15 rows of people deep, people everywhere. When you have a 20 person line at every women’s toilet, you’ve let too many people into your museum.\n\nAlso, on a 75 degree day the museum was warmer than the outside and downright humid in places. The heat detracted from the experience along with the crowds.\n\nTips:\n-Enter via the carousel entrance. It has a much shorter line than the pyramid.\n-Purchase timed tickets for 9am and hope the museum opens on time (we were stuck in the plaza for 45 min due to a delayed opening) OR purchase the Louvre membership and enjoy a fast track queue and the ability to enter/exit exit throughout the day.\n-Bring your patience, hydrate, and be prepared for the crowds.",

      "text": "I'm using Paris Museum Pass, just join the line via Entrance C.\n\nThis is one of the coolest art museums in Paris, it’s a must-visit if you’re Van Gogh's fan or simply into art. What makes it really special is that the building itself used to be a huge train station, it was the Gare d’Orsay, built around the early 1900s. Instead of tearing it down, they turned it into a museum, which means you get this amazing mix of old industrial architecture and art all in one place.\n\nInside, the museum is packed with incredible artworks, mostly from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. You’ll find tons of famous Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings here, artists like Monet, Degas, Renoir, Van Gogh, and Cézanne. If you love those bright, colorful paintings or want to get a feel for the art that changed the world, this is the spot.\n\nBesides paintings, the museum also has sculptures, decorative arts, and photography. It’s pretty manageable in size, so you don’t get overwhelmed like in some bigger museums.\n\nThe museum sits right on the left bank of the Seine, close to the Louvre and the charming Saint-Germain area. So, it’s easy to fit it into a day of exploring Paris.\n\nIt's recommended to visit here. :)",

This place was a little bit challenging to get to by cab - but once you're in the park, it's quite pleasant to walk around. I spent about 15 minutes in line with pre-purchased timed entry tickets but once the line started to move I was ushered in quickly. There is an x-ray for your bag and you have to step through a metal detector. Past the initial desk is the pickup for the audio guides on your right hand side. Present your tickets to the attendant to receive clean set. I'm not sure I would recommend the audio guide, although it did let me know about the second room of Monet, which would have been heartbreaking to find out later. There are quite a few stairs, although no full case to get to the Monet. Although to get to the yard downstairs and the family room, you do need to be able to do a full staircase.",

Line two was long. It was for people who didn’t have tickets. It was still long when we walked out an hour later.\n\nI recommend getting an audio guide from the museum for 5€.\n\nThe Monet Water Lilly’s are on the ground floor and they are lovely to look at. The audio guide shares a lot of interesting information.\n\nDownstairs is an interesting art collection. Some pieces have you scratching your head, while others leave you agape.\n\nIf you’re in Paris and appreciate art, you should visit the museum.",

Now I need to calculate distances and travel times between the attractions. Let me first determine which day (Monday or Tuesday) July 28, 2025 falls on, and then plan the route accordingly.

July 28, 2025 is a Monday, so July 29, 2025 is a Tuesday.

Based on your requirements:
- Day 1 (Monday, July 28): Eastern and Southern areas - Notre Dame Cathedral, Panthéon
- Day 2 (Tuesday, July 29): Western and Central areas - Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre Museum, Musée d'Orsay, Musée de l'Orangerie

Let me calculate the distances and travel times:

Perfect! I've created your two-day Paris travel itinerary based on your wishlist and requirements. Here's what I've planned for you:

## **Day 1 (Monday, July 28, 2025) - Eastern & Southern Areas**

**Starting Point: Notre Dame Cathedral**
- **Address**: 6 Parvis Notre-Dame - Pl. Jean-Paul II, 75004 Paris, France
- **Opening Hours**: 7:50 AM – 7:00 PM
- **Next Stop**: 1.1 km walk (16 minutes) to Panthéon

**Second Stop: Panthéon**
- **Address**: Pl. du Panthéon, 75005 Paris, France
- **Opening Hours**: 10:00 AM – 6:30 PM
- **Final destination for Day 1**

## **Day 2 (Tuesday, July 29, 2025) - Western & Central Areas**

**Starting Point: Eiffel Tower**
- **Address**: Av. Gustave Eiffel, 75007 Paris, France
- **Opening Hours**: 9:30 AM – 11:00 PM
- **Next Stop**: 2.4 km walk (35 minutes) to Arc de Triomphe

**Second Stop: Arc de Triomphe**
- **Address**: Pl. Charles de Gaulle, 75008 Paris, France
- **Opening Hours**: 10:00 AM – 10:30 PM
- **Next Stop**: 2.9 km walk (40 minutes) to Louvre Museum

**Third Stop: Louvre Museum**
- **Address**: 75001 Paris, France
- **Opening Hours**: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM
- **Next Stop**: 0.3 km walk (4 minutes) to Musée de l'Orangerie

**Fourth Stop: Musée de l'Orangerie**
- **Address**: Jardin des Tuileries, 75001 Paris, France
- **Opening Hours**: Closed (Tuesdays)
- **Next Stop**: 0.4 km walk (5 minutes) to Musée d'Orsay

**Final Stop: Musée d'Orsay**
- **Address**: Esplanade Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, 75007 Paris, France
- **Opening Hours**: 9:30 AM – 6:00 PM

## **Important Notes:**

1. **Musée de l'Orangerie is closed on Tuesdays**, so you won't be able to visit it on Day 2. You might want to consider visiting it on a different day or rearranging your schedule.

2. The itinerary follows a logical geographical path to minimize walking distances while respecting your preference for eastern/southern areas on Day 1 and western/central areas on Day 2.

3. All walking times are estimates and may vary depending on your pace and crowds.

4. I recommend booking tickets in advance for the museums, especially the Louvre, as they can get very crowded.

The itinerary has been saved as 'Paris_Itinerary.json' in the specified format you requested!

I did it and it's a great experience!\n\nIt is a must, if you are visiting Paris. Definitely, don't skip this of your list.",

There was a mass taking place when we visited so it was very busy inside but it was lovely to hear the organ music and singing showcasing the wonderful acoustics.  I would recommend timing your visit to coincidence with a service as this is an experience not to be missed.  The artwork and stained glass are exquisite and you have a real sense of history as you walk round this remarkable building which had played such an central part in the story of the French nation.",

      "text": "I'm using Paris Museum Pass, just join the line via Entrance C.\n\nThis is one of the coolest art museums in Paris, it’s a must-visit if you’re Van Gogh's fan or simply into art. What makes it really special is that the building itself used to be a huge train station, it was the Gare d’Orsay, built around the early 1900s. Instead of tearing it down, they turned it into a museum, which means you get this amazing mix of old industrial architecture and art all in one place.\n\nInside, the museum is packed with incredible artworks, mostly from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. You’ll find tons of famous Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings here, artists like Monet, Degas, Renoir, Van Gogh, and Cézanne. If you love those bright, colorful paintings or want to get a feel for the art that changed the world, this is the spot.\n\nBesides paintings, the museum also has sculptures, decorative arts, and photography. It’s pretty manageable in size, so you don’t get overwhelmed like in some bigger museums.\n\nThe museum sits right on the left bank of the Seine, close to the Louvre and the charming Saint-Germain area. So, it’s easy to fit it into a day of exploring Paris.\n\nIt's recommended to visit here. :)",

It would take days to go through it all, so I'd sincerely suggest a guide to maximize your time viewing the impressive collection.  If you can, plan your visit before or after summer, and avoid holidays.  I'd also suggest viewing the more iconic items close to closing time.  The crowds thin out and you'll have a better viewing experience.  Otherwise, try hard to be in the first group to enter and quickly go to the more popular items as quickly as possible.  Either way, have a plan.  Visit the museum's website and know what you want to see and where you need to go.  Absolutely buy tickets ahead of time.  There's stairs, escalators, lifts, and ramps to transit.  We walked 3 miles in just over 2 hours, so expect to walk - a lot.",

The building and art are overwhelming and you could spend days inside here.\n\nHowever, over crowding is detracting from the experience. It is packed - lines for the toilets, Mona Lisa is 15 rows of people deep, people everywhere. When you have a 20 person line at every women’s toilet, you’ve let too many people into your museum.\n\nAlso, on a 75 degree day the museum was warmer than the outside and downright humid in places. The heat detracted from the experience along with the crowds.\n\nTips:\n-Enter via the carousel entrance. It has a much shorter line than the pyramid.\n-Purchase timed tickets for 9am and hope the museum opens on time (we were stuck in the plaza for 45 min due to a delayed opening) OR purchase the Louvre membership and enjoy a fast track queue and the ability to enter/exit exit throughout the day.\n-Bring your patience, hydrate, and be prepared for the crowds.",

They even have a children’s activity area, which is a lovely touch for families, as well as a few other types of art exhibitions beyond Impressionism.",

There is also a kids activity room and a fairly decent toilet and water bottle filling station. This place was a little bit challenging to get to by cab - but once you're in the park, it's quite pleasant to walk around. I spent about 15 minutes in line with pre-purchased timed entry tickets but once the line started to move I was ushered in quickly. There is an x-ray for your bag and you have to step through a metal detector. Past the initial desk is the pickup for the audio guides on your right hand side. Present your tickets to the attendant to receive clean set. I'm not sure I would recommend the audio guide, although it did let me know about the second room of Monet, which would have been heartbreaking to find out later. There are quite a few stairs, although no full case to get to the Monet. Although to get to the yard downstairs and the family room, you do need to be able to do a full staircase.",

The l’Orangerie’s website said they were sold out so I bought four tickets on Viator (spent ~25% more), but we arrived and there were two lines and we were pointed to line one and maybe waited 10 minutes before we went in. Line two was long. It was for people who didn’t have tickets. It was still long when we walked out an hour later.\n\nI recommend getting an audio guide from the museum for 5€.\n\nThe Monet Water Lilly’s are on the ground floor and they are lovely to look at. The audio guide shares a lot of interesting information.\n\nDownstairs is an interesting art collection. Some pieces have you scratching your head, while others leave you agape.\n\nIf you’re in Paris and appreciate art, you should visit the museum.",

      "text": "5/5 ⭐ – Eiffel Tower\nAn absolute must-see in Paris and even more impressive in person than in photos. The structure is massive, with incredible views from every level. Going up at sunset is highly recommended as you can watch the city light up while still seeing it in daylight. The tower sparkles every hour at night, which is a highlight of the visit and creates a great atmosphere along the Seine. Security and entry lines are well-organized, though still busy, so booking tickets in advance saves time. The surrounding Champ de Mars park is clean, spacious, and perfect for photos or a picnic. A world-class landmark that fully lives up to its reputation.",

I have created a two-day Paris travel itinerary based on your wishlist.
The itinerary is balanced to accommodate the opening hours of the attractions. Due to the closing days of the museums, the Louvre Museum, which is in the central area, is scheduled for the first day. The rest of the itinerary follows your requested geographical focus.

The itinerary has been saved to `/workspace/dumps/workspace/Paris_Itinerary.json`.
