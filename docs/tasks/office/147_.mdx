## Instruction

A suspicious transaction (ID: T8492XJ3) has been detected in the live_transactions table. Please query all data related to this transaction ID from the transactions_analytics dataset and consolidate the results into a single JSON object, where each table name serves as a key containing its corresponding data. Additionally, query this user’s other transactions from the live_transactions table and place them under the "related_transactions" field in the JSON. Store the complete JSON object in the workspace, then upload it to our secure mcp-fraud-investigation-archive storage bucket, using the transaction ID as the filename (T8492XJ3.json). After archiving, you must immediately write a CRITICAL-level alert log entry to the Trading_Logging log bucket, with the structured payload: \{'alert_type': 'Fraud', 'transaction_id': 'T8492XJ3', 'status': 'Pending_Investigation'\}
