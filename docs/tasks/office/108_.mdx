## Instruction

Please convert the file `Household_Appliances.xlsx` from its current two-dimensional layout—where sales data for household refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines are recorded in separate columns—into a one-dimensional format. The new layout must strictly follow the structure an d examples shown in `Format_Example.xlsx`, leaving any unknown fields blank.  

Save the transformed data as `Processed.xlsx` in the workspace. List the records in reverse chronological order, starting from December 2024 and moving backward, and include only months with at least some data.
