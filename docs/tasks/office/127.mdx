## Instruction

As an HR, I've just finished a day of interviews and have several candidates' resumes (in Candidates_resumes.docx) and interviewer evaluations (in Interviewer_evaluation.docx). You need to help me create a structured and uniformly formatted Word-based evaluation report for each candidate. 
First, please read all the candidates' resumes and the interviewer evaluations, then create a separate Word document for each candidate following the formatting guidelines provided in Format.md.
Finally, create a new document named recommend.txt, which should only contain the name of the best candidate.
