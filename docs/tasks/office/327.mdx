## Instruction

You are a professional job search assistant. You need to manage a Notion page named `Job Finder` that contains a database called `Job Tracker` to track job application information.

For companies with status `Checking` that meet the following criteria:

- Minimum salary requirement > $3000
- Must be on-site work
- Company location within 500 km of UCLA
- Position is "software engineer" or "software manager"

send job application email using template: "Hi \{Company Name\}, I am Janet Mendoza, I want to apply for the \{Position\} position...", titled with "Job Application for \{Position\}" and update the Status of that entry to `Applied`.
