## Instruction

Only edit the TODO part at the end of the appendix within my paper Latex project, without affecting any other content of the paper to help me do so: Add a new section at the end of the appendix to display the Simple Prompt and the Complex Prompt we actually used, in a box style exactly the same in M-STAR (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17451). You can find these needed prompts in our codebase. You only need to replace the text part of the box without modifying any style, color or fontsize etc, except that you must use '\\' for new lines, please just set the names of the boxes as `Simple Prompt` and `Complex Prompt`. You also need to handle proper package import and consistent color definition if necessary (this is the only edit you can make besides the TODO part). Do not change the file names in my paper project.

\begin{abstract}
% Advanced large language model has achieved leading performance
% Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with high-level reasoning mechanisms such as reflection and verification, has been shown to be a powerful approach for scaling test-time computation and achieving remarkable performance in extremely complex reasoning tasks.

% Advanced models can perform long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on complex tasks to achieve enhanced performance. 
DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models—a paradigm referred to as \emph{zero RL training}. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities.
In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. 
% can several critical questions remain unanswered: (1) Can smaller, various base models exhibit similar emergent reasoning with limited, simple data? (2) Does increased CoT length always lead to increased cognitive phenomena such as self-reflection (i.e., the``aha moment'')? (3) What are the essential designs that enable the emergence of long CoT? In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as an example and try to answer these questions. We conduct extensive zero-training experiments across various base models, spanning different families and sizes, including LLama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeekMath-7B, and Qwen2.5-0.5B/1.5B/7B/14B/32B. To keep the recipe simple, we restrict our training data to the original GSM8K and MATH datasets. 
Leveraging several key design strategies—such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty—we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings.
However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the ``aha moment"). Notably, we observe the ``aha moment'' for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family.
% Through comprehensive analyses of the results, we uncover several intriguing findings. For example, increased CoT length does not always correspond to the ``aha moment'', and different base models exhibit distinct behaviors during training. 
% We also compare our approach to traditional RL pipelines that follow a traditional SFT stage, demonstrating that such common practices can slow down or even inhibit the emergence of long CoT reasoning. 
We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. 
To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.
% \qian{I think we can mention somewhere that we employ the same data and the same hyper-parameter to make it work on every model, and it would be really impressive.}
% \footnote{A preliminary result of this paper based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B was reported in a \href{https://hkust-nlp.notion.site/simplerl-reason?pvs=4}{blog} released concurrently with DeepSeek-R1~\citep{guo2025deepseek}.

% Advanced models can perform long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on complex tasks by leveraging high-level mechanisms like reflection. 
% Recently, open-source flagship long-CoT models such as DeepSeek-R1 have introduced a simple yet effective rule-based reward design, using pure reinforcement learning (RL) directly from base models without any supervised fine-tuning (SFT)—a process known as ``zero training". However, most recent efforts have concentrated on a limited series of models and have not thoroughly analyzed the critical underlying factors contributing to the success of such seemingly simple designs. In this paper, we investigates the mechanisms and challenges associated with ``zero training" in LLM, focusing on the emergence of high-level reasoning mechanisms during RL training. We explore how reasoning behaviors evolve across different series of models ranging in size from 1.5B to 32B parameters, and analyze the critical factors contributing to successful ``zero training". Using limited open-source datasets like GSM8K and MATH, we demonstrate significant performance improvements and increased response lengths, highlighting the emergence of reflection-like reasoning across different models. Through fine-grained monitoring, we uncover key challenges that affect both training stability and overall performance.
% %Through find-grained monitoring, we identify key challenges, including weak zero-shot capabilities, rigid formatting constraints, and misalignment between data difficulty and model capabilities. These factors impact both training stability and performance.  
% Furthermore, we reveal the surprising limitations of traditional SFT methods, which, while effective for short-term performance gains, hinder model exploration and constrain the development of advanced reasoning abilities. Our findings offer essential insights into RL training dynamics and suggest directions for scalable zero-training in the future.

% 1. The first comprehensive experiment to perform zero RL training on different base models (apart from the Qwen base model) and conduct in-depth analysis, including analysis of length and performance, using comprehensive metrics (including pass@k) to analyze length changes, and whether reflection is produced (in this experimental setting, we need to align most of the settings). **TODO:** We need to quickly align key settings, including whether to remove formatting, the difficulty level of prompts used, and finalize the experiments.
% 2. Analysis of key tricks affecting zero experiment effectiveness, including stop ids, reward design (with or without format), prompt difficulty design, and other key hyperparameters such as batch size/KL coefficient/temperature. **TODO:** We need to select 2-3 representative models for analysis experiments
% 3. Comprehensive analysis of why base models may or may not produce emergence, including patterns of emergence in base models, pass@K factors. Establish connections between base models and the aha momentTODO:
% 4. Explain why traditional SFT experiments don't work? For example, why might using short CoT for SFT be harmful? (Expected conclusion: using short CoT for SFT suppresses emergence) TODO: Also conduct SFT on the representative models from point 2 for analysis experiments

\section{Key Factors Shaping Zero RL Training}
In this section, we identify key factors that influence stability and performance during zero RL training, particularly when dealing with early-stage or weaker models.  
First, we explore how an over-reliance on format rewards restricts exploration. Next, we analyze how data difficulty impacts exploratory behavior, illustrating how exposure to varying levels of difficulty shapes the exploration dynamics. We also discuss the impact of exploration-related hyperparameters in Appendix~\ref{sec:impact_explore_hyper}.

% 基本上可以照着做不work的角度走了
% First, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex instructions, such as formatting answers within specific boxes. Second, many base models tend to generate sequences continuously, failing to stop once the question has been answered. These issues lead to a high volume of irrelevant outputs in the early stages of training, contributing to model collapse, where the models get stuck in repetitive, meaningless loops.  To address this, we systematically analyze the impact of such behavior and propose straightforward yet effective solutions to mitigate these problems. \wz{This content is more about tricks, it would be better to move it to the appendix or remove it}




\subsection{Over-Reliance on Format Rewards}

We find that enforcing strict formatting constraints, such as requiring the final answer to be enclosed in a latex command \textit{\textbackslash boxed\{\}}, can hinder model's freely exploration and ultimately degrades performance. This is because many base models cannot follow the format constraint well in the initial stage, and imposing a format reward will penalize many correct explorations. We compare two reward functions: one without format constraints, which rewards responses solely based on answer correctness (our default design in \textsection\ref{sec:reward_remove}), and another that strictly enforces formatting by penalizing responses with a reward of -1 if they fail to adhere to the required format.

    \vspace{-5pt}
\end{wrapfigure}


Figure~\ref{fig:w&wo_format_reward} illustrates weaker models like Llama-3.1-8B struggle under strict formatting requirements, leading to a rapid increase in response length early in training without performancec improvement. The model expends excessive effort on adhering to the format but fails to learn how to answer correctly, ultimately resulting in model collapse. 
Figure~\ref{fig:w&wo_format_reward} (Left) further reveals that even stronger models, such as Qwen-2.5-7B, which initially comply with formatting constraints, suffer in later training stages. This includes both performance degradation and a significant reduction in CoT length.

%     \vspace{-20pt}
% \end{wrapfigure}
% \wz{Here the total length with format reward is much longer, I'm wondering if we need to explain this using other metrics}
These findings highlight that: in a zero RL training setting, rather than imposing rigid formatting rules, we should prioritize maintaining response verifiability while allowing sufficient flexibility for exploration.

\subsection{Data Difficulty on Exploratory Behavior}
\label{sec:data_complextiy_behaviur}
Base models exhibit varying performance and CoT behaviors when trained on different RL data. Figure~\ref{fig:mathlv} compare the performance of Mistral-7B and Qwen-2.5-7B across Easy, Medium, and Hard datasets. We observe a clear trend: as data difficulty increases, Mistral-7B's performance progressively deteriorates. When faced with high-difficulty data (Hard: MATH levels 3-5), the model struggles to generate responses that receive positive feedback from the reward system. This failure results in a significant increase in response length without any corresponding improvement in accuracy, signaling a breakdown in the training process—often referred to as training collapse. Figure~\ref{fig:mathlv} Left demonstrates that Qwen-2.5-7B exhibits a pattern entirely opposite to Mistral-7B-v0.1. Specifically, as dataset difficulty decreases, both the model’s average accuracy and response length decline, with the effect being most pronounced on the simplest dataset, where even response length decreases. This finding aligns with our previous analysis of Qwen-2.5-7B in \textsection\ref{sec:qwen_behabiur}, reinforcing the notion that Qwen inherently possesses strong reasoning capabilities. To further improve its response length, training should incorporate more challenging datasets to encourage deeper reasoning and extended thinking time.
The analysis highlights that zero RL training data must align with the base model's inherent reasoning capabilities.

% In this section, we examine the effects of exploration-related hyperparameters on "zero-training." Drawing inspiration from ~\citet{zeng2024b}, we focus on two key factors: sampling size (the number of responses per query) and sampling temperature.

% \paragraph{Sampling Size\jhc{}{:}} We examine how varying sampling sizes $N \in \{1,4,8,16,32\}$ influence the training process using the Mistral 24B model; these results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:sampling_number}. Our analysis reveals a clear trend: as $N$ increases, the model's average performance notably improves, and variability in response lengths becomes significantly more stable. For example, after 100 training steps, the scenario with $N=32$ achieves an average accuracy approximately 6 points higher than that with $N=8$. Conversely, smaller sampling sizes ($N=1$ and $N=4$) cause training instability and potential collapse, indicated by rapid growth in generated length without corresponding accuracy improvements. We hypothesize that larger sample sizes enable the model to explore a broader and more diverse training space, which stabilizes advantage estimation and sustains continuous performance improvement.

% \paragraph{Sampling Temperature\jhc{}{:}} We conduct research on Qwen-2.5-0.5B to analyze the impact of sampling temperature during both training and evaluation on model performance. The results, presented in Figure~\ref{fig:train_sample_temperature} , indicate that training with higher temperatures generally leads to better average performance. For instance, models trained with temperatures of 1.0 and 1.2 outperform those trained with 0.8 and 0.6. Additionally, we find that the optimal evaluation temperature depends on the training temperature. Specifically, models trained at higher temperatures require higher sampling temperatures during evaluation, as using greedy sampling often results in repetitive outputs. Conversely, models trained at lower temperatures perform best when evaluated with lower sampling temperatures.


\section{Revisiting Traditional SFT for RL-Driven Reasoning Emergence}

\label{sec:short_cot_influence}




\begin{figure}[!t]
        \centering

\caption{Reasoning behavior ratio over RL training iterations after using different SFT steps as starting points. ``Base" refers to the base Mistral-Small-24B model without any SFT, while ``Step 100" and ``Step 500" represent 100 and 500 steps of SFT, respectively. As described in \S\ref{sec:setup}, we use GPT-4o to track shifts in reasoning behaviors on OlympiadBench.}
        %\vspace{-15pt}
         \label{fig:sft_behaviur}
\end{figure}



As base models may not follow instruction well and pose a major challenge for zero RL training, one may wonder a simple SFT stage as a cold start may be helpful to learn to follow instructions well. In this section, we revisit the impact of traditional SFT methods (where the responses are not from long CoT models) as a cold start on RL training performance and reasoning behavior--notably, this was the most commonly used post-training pipeline with RL following an SFT stage, before DeepSeek-R1. Specifically, we use a subset of the NuminaMath~\citep{li2024numinamath} dataset derived from GSM8K and MATH,~\footnote{We also conduct experiments using general SFT dataset beyond math-related ones, which can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:general_sft} and implies similar conclusion.} containing approximately 15K high-quality short CoT responses. We conduct SFT using Mistral 24B and select models at 100 and 500 training steps as starting points for RL training. 
% \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.48\columnwidth}

%     \label{fig:sft_accuracy_length} 
%     %\vspace{-10pt}
% \end{wrapfigure}

Figure~\ref{fig:sft_accuracy_length} illustrates how model accuracy and output length evolve during RL training when different initial models are used. Our results indicate that starting from SFT models initially boosts performance significantly; however, these models encounter notable limitations in their maximum achievable accuracy and response length compared to starting from the base model during RL training. Crucially, we observe that these limitations become increasingly pronounced as the number of initial SFT steps grows.


\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.48\columnwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/plot_figure9_v2_diff_n-mistral-24b.pdf}
    %\vspace{-10pt}

    \label{fig:sft_accuracy_length} 
    %\vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

%For instance, while the base model can attain a pass@1 accuracy of approximately 49.6\% during RL training, models initialized with 100 and 500 SFT steps achieve maximum accuracies of only about 47.3\% and 40.3\%, respectively.

%For instance, \jh{need to cite the table here}while the base model can attain a pass@1 accuracy of approximately \jhc{72}{72\%} on MATH-500 during RL training, models initialized with 100 and 500 SFT steps achieve maximum accuracies of only about \jhc{68}{68\%} and \jhc{59}{59\%}, respectively.

To further investigate how initial SFT affects the emergence of reasoning behaviors, we analyze how often specific reasoning behaviors appeared during training at different starting points, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sft_behaviur}. Our analysis reveals that initial SFT negatively impacts the development of critical reasoning behaviors. Specifically, models with 100 SFT steps exhibit reduced upper limits in essential reasoning behaviors such as "enumeration," "verification," and "backtracking," compared to the base model. Even more notably, models with 500 SFT steps experience significant declines in "enumeration" and "verification" behaviors in later training stages, highlighting a detrimental long-term effect of extensive sft on reasoning capabilities.
% \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.48\columnwidth}

%     \label{fig:sft_accuracy_length}
% \end{wrapfigure}
This prompts a reconsideration of whether traditional SFT inherently restricts model exploration, perhaps highlighting the need for future cold-start strategies to prioritize exploration capacity—whether by incorporating long CoT data~\citep{guo2025deepseek,yeo2025demystifying} or designing SFT techniques~\citep{li2025preserving} that strike a balance between imitation and exploration—to enable sustained improvements in model reasoning performance.

\section{Conclusion}
Our paper demonstrates the effectiveness of zero RL training across a diverse range of base models, yielding significant improvements in accuracy and response length. We provide strong evidence that zero RL training is not merely reranking, but rather a genuine enhancement. Furthermore, we identify key factors such as reward design, data difficulty, and models' inherent abilities that shape the emergence of advanced reasoning behaviors. Our findings also indicate that starting RL training from models with traditional SFT may limit the development of advanced reasoning behaviors. Overall, our work highlights key factors for effective zero RL training and offers insights for future model improvements.

\section{Detailed Background: ``Zero RL Training"}
\label{sec:detailed_grpo}
% DeepSeek-R1-Zero~\citep{guo2025deepseek} demonstrates that reasoning capabilities can be effectively developed through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as an initial step. We follow this ``zero RL training" approach, conduct our experiments on various open base models 
In our study, we follow the zero RL training recipe in ~\citet{guo2025deepseek} using various open base models, employing the GRPO algorithm~\citep{shao2024deepseekmath}. Here, zero RL training refers to reinforcement learning directly from the base model without any prior supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
%Additional experiments exploring alternative algorithms are included in the Appendix xxxx. 
GRPO optimizes computational efficiency by eliminating the need for a separate value model; instead, it directly utilizes group-normalized rewards to estimate advantages. For a query \( q \) and a set of responses \( O = \{o_1, o_2, \dots, o_G\} \) sampled from the old policy model \( \pi_{\text{old}} \), we adopt a token-level, length-rectified GRPO objective to optimize the policy model \( \pi \):\footnote{The original GRPO objective has a length normalization term that introduces length biases. We remove the length normalization term similar to concurrent works~\citep{yu2025dapoopensourcellmreinforcement,liu2025understanding} -- this length-rectified objective was the default implementation of GRPO in our adapted codebase, verl~\citep{sheng2024hybridflow}.}
% \begin{align}
% \mathcal{J}_{GRPO}(\theta) &= \mathbb{E}[q \sim P(Q), \{ o_i \}_{i=1}^G \sim \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(O|q)] \\
% &= \frac{1}{G} \sum_{i=1}^{G} \frac{1}{|o_i|} \sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} \left\{ \min \left[ \frac{\pi_{\theta}(o_{i,t} | q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(o_{i,t} | q, o_{i,<t})} \hat{A}_{i}, 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon \right] \right\} - \beta \mathbb{D}_{KL} [\pi_{\theta} || \pi_{\text{ref}}]
% \end{align}


% \begin{equation}
%     \begin{split}
%         \mathcal{J}_{\text{GRPO}}(\theta) 
%         = & \underset{\text{Clipped policy update}}{\underbrace{\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{G}|o_{i}|} \sum_{i=1}^G\sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} \min\left[ r_{i,t}(\theta) \hat{A}_i,\, \operatorname{clip}\left(r_{i,t}(\theta); 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon\right) \hat{A}_i \right]}} \\
%         & - \underset{\text{KL penalty}}{\underbrace{\beta \, \mathbb{D}_{\text{KL}}[\pi_\theta \parallel \pi_{\text{ref}}]}}
%     \end{split}
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{J}_{\text{GRPO}}(\theta) &= \underbrace{\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{G}|o_{i}|} \sum_{i=1}^G\sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} \min\left[ r_{i,t}(\theta) \hat{A}_i,\, \operatorname{clip}\left(r_{i,t}(\theta); 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon\right) \hat{A}_i \right]}_{\text{Clipped policy update}} 
        - \underbrace{\beta \, \mathbb{D}_{\text{KL}}[\pi_\theta \parallel \pi_{\text{ref}}]}_{\text{KL penalty}} \\
        &\text{where } r_{i,t}(\theta)=\frac{\pi_\theta(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


% \begin{equation}
%         \mathcal{J}_{\text{GRPO}}(\theta) = \underset{\text{Clipped policy update}}{\underbrace{\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{G}|o_{i}|} \sum_{i=1}^G\sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} \min\left[ \frac{\pi_\theta(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})} \hat{A}_i,\, \operatorname{clip}(\frac{\pi_\theta(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}; 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_i \right]}}  - \underset{\text{KL penalty}}{\underbrace{\beta \, \mathbb{D}_{\text{KL}}[\pi_\theta \parallel \pi_{\text{ref}}]}}
% \end{equation}

where  \( \pi_{\text{ref}} \) represents the reference model, and the term \( \mathbb{D}_{KL} \) introduces a KL divergence constraint to limit how much the model can deviate from this reference. The advantage estimate \( \hat{A}_i \) measures how much better the response \( o_i \) is compared to the average response, which is computed using a group of rewards \( \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_G\} \) for the responses in set \( O \):
\begin{equation}
   \hat{A}_i = \frac{r_i - \text{mean}(\{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_G\})}{\text{std}(\{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_G\})}
\end{equation}

\section{Detailed Experimental Setup}
\label{appx:detailed_setup}
\subsection{Dataset}
% \label{sec:dataset_setting}
To keep the training recipe simple, we select training data exclusively from the GSM8K~\citep{cobbe2021training} and MATH~\citep{hendrycks2021measuring} datasets. 
For the MATH dataset, following prior studies~\citep{lightman2023let, wang2023math, sun2024easy}, we reserve the MATH500 subset as the test set, uniformly sample an additional 500 problems for validation, and combine the remaining 4,000 test problems with the original 7,500 training problems to form our training set. Each example in the MATH dataset is originally labeled with a difficulty level ranging from 1 to 5. In our experiments, we find that data difficulty is critical for successful zero RL (\textsection\ref{sec:data_complextiy_behaviur}) and it is necessary to use data that aligns with the model's capability. To investigate this phenomenon, we categorize the data into three difficulty levels: Easy (GSM8K and MATH lv.1), Medium (MATH lv.1–4), and Hard (MATH lv.3–5), with each category containing roughly 8,000 problems. 
For our main training runs, we use Easy for LLama-3.1-8B, Mistral- v0.1-7B, and DeepSeek-Math-7B; Medium for Qwen-2.5-0.5B; Hard for Mistral-Small-24B, Qwen-2.5-Math-7B, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B/7B/14B/32B, and we will report ablation study on data difficulty in \textsection\ref{sec:data_complextiy_behaviur}. 


% \label{sec:reward_remove}

\subsection{Reward} 
% \label{sec:reward_remove}
We use a rule-based reward function that assigns rewards solely based on the correctness of the generated response: a correct final answer receives a reward of +1, while an incorrect one receives a reward of 0. Recent studies~\citep{deepscaler2025,chen2025empirical} often incorporate format-based rules into reward calculation, encouraging the model to follow specific output formats. However, we find that this approach may hinder the model's exploration and ultimately harm its performance particularly for the base models which struggle with following the format in the initial stage, as detailed in \textsection\ref{sec:remove_format}.

% We also discuss the impact of incorporating format-based rewards on training in \textsection\ref{}.

\subsection{Models} 
We conduct zero RL training experiments on Llama-3.1-8B~\citep{dubey2024llama}, DeepSeek-Math-7B~\citep{shao2024deepseekmath}, Mistral-v0.1-7B~\citep{jiang2023mistral7b}, Mistral-Small-24b-Base-2501~\citep{mistral2024small}, and Qwen-2.5 (0.5B, 1.5B, 7B, 14B, 32B)~\citep{yang2024qwen2}.
As we perform experiments for a variety of models, under extremely simple settings with small, simple datasets and only correctness reward, we refer to our obtained models as \emph{SimpleRL-Zoo} to represent a simple training recipe for a zoo of open base models.
For models with weaker instruction-following capabilities (Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-v0.1-7B, and Qwen-2.5-0.5B/1.5B), we employ simpler prompts~\citep{abel} requiring only step-by-step reasoning. For models with stronger instruction-following abilities, we use more complex prompts~\citep{yang2024qwen2} that require the final answers to be placed in boxes. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that using complex prompts with models that have weak instruction-following capabilities often results in large amounts of irrelevant or nonsensical content being generated early in training, leading to instability.
The content of simpler prompts and more complex prompts is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prompt_case} in Appendix.

%         \label{fig:prompt_case}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Benchmark} 
We evaluate performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K~\citep{cobbe2021training}, MATH 500~\citep{hendrycks2021measuring}, Minerva Math~\citep{lewkowycz2022solving}, and OlympiadBench~\citep{he2024olympiadbench}, as well as on competition-level benchmarks such as AIME 2024 and AMC 2023. 
% We also evaluate the generalization ability of zero RL training using three benchmarks: IFEVAL~\citep{zhou2023instruction}, MMLU~\citep{hendrycks2020measuring}, and GPQA-Diamond~\citep{rein2024gpqa}. IFEVAL measures instruction-following capability, MMLU assesses the model's mastery of general knowledge, and GPQA-Diamond is a challenging benchmark that tests domain-specific expertise in chemistry, physics, and biology.
% \jh{We also need to mention that we also test generalization, on xxx benchmarks}
% \yh{
% \subsection{Other Configurations:}
% % \jh{I think we need to talk some important training/eval configs. for example, the rollout size (which is relevant to pass@k), the training max length and eval max length that we will mention again later, and mention we use verl [cite]. For some detailed configs that we want include in appendix (batch size, some GRPO hyperparams), we also need to cite that appendix here}
% We train our models using the verl~\citep{sheng2024hybridflow} framework. We provide detailed training and evaluation details in the Appendix ~\ref{sec:train_evaluate_details}.
% \label{sec:train_evaluate_details}
% We typically use the same set of hyperparameters to train and evaluate all models in the SimpleRL-Zoo series in default main experiment setting.

\subsection{Training and Evaluation Details}

\label{sec:train_evaluate_details}
We train our models using the verl~\citep{sheng2024hybridflow} framework. And we typically use the same set of hyperparameters to train and evaluate all models in the SimpleRL-Zoo series in default main experiment setting. We use a prompt batch size of 1,024 and generate 8 rollouts per prompt, with a maximum rollout length of 8,192 tokens. Training is performed using a mini-batch size of 256. The default sampling temperature is set to 1.0, and the clip ratio is 0.2. For models ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, we use a KL loss coefficient of 1e-4. For models larger than 14B, the KL loss coefficient is set to 1e-3. We build our evaluation script based on ~\citet{yang2024qwen2math}, using a temperature of 1.0 and a maximum generation length of 16K tokens. To ensure consistency, we adopt the same prompt template used during training. For most benchmarks, we report pass@1 results. However, for AIME 2024, which contains fewer problems, we report both pass@1 and average accuracy (avg@32), computed over 32 generated samples per problem.

\section{Detailed Evaluation Metrics}
\label{appx:eval_detail}
\paragraph{Reasoning Behavior Ratio:} To better understand the model's reasoning patterns throughout the training process, we adopt the cognitive behavior framework proposed by ~\citet{gandhi2025cognitive} and use GPT-4o~\citep{hurst2024gpt} to identify reasoning-related behaviors, including ``Backtracking", ``Verification", ``Subgoal Setting", and ``Enumeration". 
We report the ratio of responses that contain such cognitive behaviors.
While some recent studies suggest tracking reflection behavior using related keywords~\citep{yeo2025demystifying,xie2025logic} as monitoring signals, we argue that these keywords only exhibit only a weak correlation with high-level reasoning patterns like reflection and verification. As a result, they fail to adequately capture the development of these reasoning processes.  Further details can be found in Appendix~\ref{appx:bahaviour}.

\paragraph{Clip Ratio:} In the early stages of training, the base model exhibits weak instruction-following ability and often fails to stop appropriately, resulting in irrelevant or excessively long outputs. After training collapses, the model may also generate repetitive or overly extended responses. Since the model has a fixed maximum context length, such outputs may be truncated during both training and evaluation. To monitor this issue, we define the proportion of truncated outputs as the ``Clip Ratio".

\paragraph{Average Stopped Length:} Generations that are truncated often result from issues such as repetitive patterns or incomplete reasoning, which typically do not contribute to effective trajectories. To account for this factor, we introduce a new metric to track the average length of responses that are stopped under normal conditions. It is a more reliable metric to consider only valid responses, thereby eliminating the interference caused by unstopped responses.
\paragraph{Pass@k Accuracy:}
We track the pass@k accuracy, which represents the percentage of questions for which at least one correct response is obtained when sampling k responses per question. Pass@k serves as an indicator of the model's exploration capabilities and is particularly relevant for RL, as it reflects the model's ability to generate responses that can achieve a positive reward. Previously, some researchers believed that RL training might merely reorder responses within the original model distribution, as evidenced by the lack of improvement in pass@k accuracy following RL training~\citep{shao2024deepseekmath}.



\section{Detailed Result of SimpleRL}
\label{appx:DetailedResult}
Following the setup described in Section~\ref{sec:setup}, we perform ``zero training" on various base models. The trained models are then evaluated on multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH 500, Minerva Math, OlympiadBench, AIME2024, and AMC2023. The average results across all these benchmarks are presented in Figures~\ref{fig1:acc&len} and~\ref{fig2:clip&stop}. In this section, we provide more detailed results. Figure~\ref{fig:appx_acc&len} illustrates the trends in accuracy and response length, while Figure~\ref{fig:appx_clip&stop} shows the trends in clip ratio and stopped length.

% \section{Assessing Model Generalization Capability}
% \label{sec:generalization_capability}
% We also evaluate the generalization ability of zero RL training using three benchmarks: IFEVAL~\citep{zhou2023instruction}, MMLU~\citep{hendrycks2020measuring}, and GPQA-Diamond~\citep{rein2024gpqa}. IFEVAL measures instruction-following capability, MMLU assesses the model's mastery of general knowledge, and GPQA-Diamond is a challenging benchmark that tests domain-specific expertise in chemistry, physics, and biology.





% Table~\ref{table:generalization_performance} presents the changes in model performance on IFEval, MMLU, and GPQA-Diamond before and after training. Despite zero RL training being conducted on only ~8K math reasoning-related examples, the model generalizes effectively across a range of tasks. Notably, it shows significant gains in instruction-following and general knowledge on IFEval and MMLU, as well as substantial improvements on the challenging GPQA-Diamond benchmark, which spans chemistry, physics, and biology.

\section{Quantitative Behavior Validation}
\label{sec:human_consistency}
We assess the consistency between GPT-4o labeled reasoning behaviors and human annotations by having human experts annotate 105 model outputs. Table~\ref{tab:human_consistency} below presents the prediction rates and agreement rate. The prediction rate reflects how frequently each reasoning behavior is identified, while the agreement rate is the proportion of data on which the labelers (Human and GPT-4o) make the same prediction.

Our results indicate a generally good level of agreement between GPT-4o and human annotations. However, GPT-4o tends to be more conservative when labeling certain behaviors such as Verification and Subgoal Setting. Upon closer examination, we observe that in cases with long CoT containing multiple reasoning behaviors, the model often favors labeling more obvious behaviors like Enumeration, while overlooking subtler ones.

\caption{Experimental results from multiple Mistral-Small-24B models, each fine-tuned with a different number of SFT steps on a general SFT dataset for RL.

The reported benchmarks reflect the performance metrics on various evaluation benchmarks, measured using the model that achieved the best average performance after 100 iterations of reinforcement learning training.}
\label{tab:general_sft_results}
\end{table}

We also investigated the general SFT setting beyond math-related datasets. In this setup, we first conducted SFT on Mistral-Small-24B using the widely adopted OpenHermes-2.5 dataset.\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5}} We implement with LLaMA-Factory~\citep{zheng-etal-2024-llamafactory} and adopt common hyperparameters of SFT, including 512 examples per batch with a constant learning rate of 1e-5. For consistency with our other experiments, we fine-tuned the model using the Qwen chat template.
After SFT, we preserved multiple checkpoints at different training steps, and nearly 800 steps correspond to 1 epochs on the SFT dataset. We then performed reinforcement learning on these models using identical hyperparameters as in our zero-RL training experiments.

Table~\ref{tab:general_sft_results} presents our findings, with performance reported as the best results achieved during RL training up to 100 iterations. The results demonstrate an inverse relationship between SFT steps and subsequent RL performance: models with more SFT steps showed diminished performance after RL training. While the average performance after 10 SFT steps remained comparable to the base model, it still exhibited some negative effects. More significantly, models with more than 20 steps showed substantially reduced RL potential.
Therefore, we conclude that RL training produces the best performance gain when applied directly to the base model without any supervised fine-tuning, i.e., the zero RL training.

\section{Impact of Exploration-Related Hyperparameters}
\label{sec:impact_explore_hyper}
In this section, we examine the effects of exploration-related hyperparameters on "zero-training." Drawing inspiration from ~\citet{zeng2024b,liu2024diving}, we focus on two key factors: sampling size (the number of responses per query) and sampling temperature.

\paragraph{Sampling Size:} We examine how varying sampling sizes $N \in \{1,4,8,16,32\}$ influence the training process using the Mistral 24B model; these results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:sampling_number}. Our analysis reveals a clear trend: as $N$ increases, the model's average performance notably improves, and variability in response lengths becomes significantly more stable. For example, after 100 training steps, the scenario with $N=32$ achieves an average accuracy approximately 6 points higher than that with $N=8$. Conversely, smaller sampling sizes ($N=1$ and $N=4$) cause training instability and potential collapse, indicated by rapid growth in generated length without corresponding accuracy improvements. We hypothesize that larger sample sizes enable the model to explore a broader and more diverse training space, which stabilizes advantage estimation and sustains continuous performance improvement.

% \end{figure}

\paragraph{Sampling Temperature:} We conduct research on Qwen-2.5-0.5B to analyze the impact of sampling temperature during both training and evaluation on model performance. The results, presented in Figure~\ref{fig:train_sample_temperature} , indicate that training with higher temperatures generally leads to better average performance. For instance, models trained with temperatures of 1.0 and 1.2 outperform those trained with 0.8 and 0.6. Additionally, we find that the optimal evaluation temperature depends on the training temperature. Specifically, models trained at higher temperatures require higher sampling temperatures during evaluation, as using greedy sampling often results in repetitive outputs. Conversely, models trained at lower temperatures perform best when evaluated with lower sampling temperatures.

\section{SimpleRL-Zoo For Qwen2.5-Math-7B}
In this section, we conduct experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B~\citep{yang2024qwen2} using the ``hard part" data, as described in \S~\ref{sec:setup}, which consists of only 8K examples from MATH lv3-5. We apply both the PPO and GRPO algorithms to train our base model, and the overall evaluation results across training steps are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qwen-math}. The final performance and response length for both algorithms converge to similar values, with GRPO slightly outperforming PPO. While the performance continues to improve, the response length does not exhibit a similar trend. Specifically, the stopping length for both algorithms remains relatively unchanged, and fluctuations in the average response length are primarily attributed to changes in the clip ratio. There are two main reasons for this behavior: First, the maximum context length for Qwen2.5-Math-7B is 4K, which is limited compared to other models with context lengths exceeding 8K, leading to a high clip ratio. Second, as a math-specific model, Qwen2.5-Math-7B already performs very well on MATH, the dataset we used for training, so it may not face enough challenge to further extend its response length. Therefore, we hypothesize that more challenging data might be needed to push this capable model further.

\section{Reasoning Behavior Analysis}
\label{appx:bahaviour}
We apply ~\citet{gandhi2025cognitive}'s cognitive behavior framework to perform a detailed analysis of how model reasoning behaviors change during "zero training." We first describe our analysis setup, then compare reflection keyword tracking against this framework to monitor reflective behaviors. Finally, we use case studies to illustrate how the reasoning behaviors of various models evolve during training.

\subsection{Setup}
\label{sec:bahaviour_setup}
We use GPT4-o to  identify and analyze the following key reasoning behaviors exhibited in the model's responses, with the prompt shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prompt_reasoning_behaviors}:

(1) \textbf{Backtracking}: The model actively identifies errors during response generation and explicitly revises previously used methods.

(2) \textbf{Verification}: The model systematically checks intermediate results to ensure correctness.

(3) \textbf{Subgoal Setting}: The model decomposes complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

(4) \textbf{Enumeration}: The model exhaustively considers multiple cases or possibilities to solve problems.

Note that we replaced "Backward Chaining" with "Enumeration," as the former was not relevant to our task.

Using DeepSeek Math's "zero-training" process as an example, we compare two different methods for monitoring reasoning behavior. The first method tracks the occurrence of specific keywords in the model's responses, such as "recheck," "rethink," "try again," "wait," "alternatively," "retry," and "however." The second method employs ~\citep{gandhi2025cognitive}'s cognitive framework for evaluation. Figure~\ref{fig:method_reasoning_behaviors} illustrates the observed changes in reasoning behavior according to these two approaches. During the training process, we observe that the proportion of specified keywords in the DeepSeek math model's responses remains consistently low, exhibiting minimal variation. Conversely, reasoning behaviors identified by the cognitive framework demonstrate a significant upward trend.

To understand this intriguing discrepancy, we manually review the reasoning behaviors recorded by the cognitive framework. Our analysis reveals that many of these reasoning behaviors do not necessarily involve the predefined keywords. For instance, in Figure~\ref{fig:deepseekmath_backtracking.png}, the observed reasoning behaviors include Verification and Backtracking, neither of which contains the specified keywords. This indicates that keywords alone cannot effectively distinguish or capture the nuanced differences between such behaviors. Similarly, in Figure~\ref{fig:deepseekmath_base_verification}, the reasoning process involves implicit verification steps, including recalculating intermediate results such as the dot product and magnitudes before determining the cosine of the angle. Again, these subtle verification steps are not represented by the designated keywords. In Figure~\ref{fig:deepseekmath_base_enumeration}, the reasoning involves considering multiple possible scenarios or outcomes. This type of exploratory reasoning is also inadequately captured by keyword-based approaches.
These examples collectively illustrate that relying solely on keyword presence is insufficient for accurately identifying and differentiating complex reasoning behaviors within model responses.

However, the scarcity of high-quality, human-annotated chain-of-thought data poses a critical challenge for advancing complex reasoning, particularly in multimodal scenarios where textual and visual reasoning intersect. \nMultimodal reasoning is a fundamental skill in many real-world applications, such as intelligent agents \\citep{liu2024visualagentbenchlargemultimodalmodels}, robotics \\citep{li2023manipllmembodiedmultimodallarge, liu2024selfcorrectedmultimodallargelanguage}, and autonomous driving \\citep{yang2023lidarllmexploringpotentiallarge}. It requires Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to understand various modalities beyond text.

However, its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning, remains underexplored, and the understanding of critical factors in this training paradigm remain limited. Furthermore, a central challenge for this training method is performance saturation, which impedes further improvements and scalability.

In contrast to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which depends on human-curated data, recent studies have shown that this imitation learning approach can be less efficient \\citep{guo2024direct} and may heighten the risk of hallucinations \\citep{gekhman2024doesfinetuningllmsnew} compared to other methods like rejective fine-tuning (RFT) \\citep{yuan2023rft} or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \\citep{schulman2017proximal}, which rely more on on-policy data. Particularly for complex reasoning tasks, training methods that utilize on-policy data have been shown to more effectively enhance models' reasoning abilities \\citep{yuan2023rft,tong2024dartmath,metallama3}.\n\nSelf-evolving training can be modeled as a general framework of reinforcement learning, where various algorithms can be formulated as a specific instantiation of RL, such as PPO \\citep{schulman2017proximal}, STaR~\\citep{zelikman2022star}, ReST~\\citep{gulcehre2023rest} and ReST$^{EM}$~\\citep{singh2023restem}.\n% Many of these approaches are essentially iterative SFT training (e.g., ReST, ReST$^{EM}$, STaR) with slight variations, \nSpecifically, given a reward function $\\mathcal{R}$, the objective of self-evolving training\n% \\jh{I have modified several places, we should use self-evolving consistently} \nis to train the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ to maximize expectation of reward $\\mathcal{R}$:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\pi_{\\theta} = \\operatorname{argmax}_{\\pi_{\\theta}}\\sum_i^L \\mathbb{E}_{x,o \\sim \\mathcal{D},\\hat{y}_i \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}[\\cdot|x,o]}[\\mathcal{R}(\\hat{y}_i)],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $x$, $o$ represent the query and image in the given training data $\\mathcal{D}$, while $\\hat{y}_i$ is a response sampled from the current policy model $\\pi_\\theta$.\nThis standard RL objective, however, can be unstable to optimize and difficult to scale up, thus a popular algorithm adopted by recent works is to decouple the response rollout $\\hat{y}_i \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}[\\cdot|x,o]$ and policy improvement into separate offline stages~\\citep{gulcehre2023rest,singh2023restem}: (1) \\emph{Generate}: the current policy model generates new responses $\\hat{y}_i \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}[\\cdot|x,o]$; and (2) \\emph{Improve}: using the rewards to selects certain responses from the Generate step, which are then used to train the policy model with a standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss. This way, the algorithm resembles Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT,~\\citet{yuan2023rft}) as it filters out negative responses in a hard manner. \nBoth steps are performed iteratively to strike a tradeoff between offline and online training. In many tasks such as mathematical problem-solving, there exists a unique, ground-truth answer $a^*$ which is utilized in the reward function, for example,~\\citet{singh2023restem} directly adopts exact match to compute a binary reward by comparing $\\hat{y}$ and $a^*$.\nIn such an iterative training procedure, the objective at iteration $t$ is to obtain an improved policy model $\\pi^{t+1}_\\theta$:\n% to maximize expectation of reward $\\mathcal{R}$, starting from the current policy model $\\pi^{t}_\\theta$ and leveraging data generated by the model itself, \n% using a learning algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$. This process can be formulated as:\n% \\vspace{-1.2cm}\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:self_evolve}\n    \\pi_{\\theta}^{t+1} = \\operatorname{argmax}_{\\pi_{\\theta}^{t}}\\sum_i^L \\mathbb{E}_{x,o,a^* \\sim \\mathcal{D},\\hat{y}_i \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}^{t}[\\cdot|x,o]}[\\mathcal{R}(a^*,\\hat{y}_i)],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the ground-truth answer $a^*$ can be empty, for example, when dealing with unlabeled inputs, the reward model must be able to score $\\hat{y}_i$ independently.\n\n\\textbf{The Design Spaces}\nThrough the lens of Eq.~\\ref{eq:self_evolve}, we can identify three dominant factors that influence the training process, (1) \\emph{training method}: the training algorithms to perform this iterative process vary as well.\nFor example, while~\\citet{gulcehre2023rest,xu2024chatglm} initialize the model from the last checkpoint at each iteration,~\\citet{zelikman2022star,singh2023restem}\n% \\jh{plz confirm whether star also initializes from the beginning, I vaguely remember it is} \nargue that initializing from the beginning checkpoint reduces overfitting and gives better performance empirically.

Equation \\ref{eq:self_evolve} closely resembles a reinforcement learning (RL) objective, and the learning algorithm can involve methods such as rejective sampling (i.e., Rejective Fine-Tuning, RFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Given the need for efficiency and scalability in training models for multimodal reasoning, i.e., the lengthened input sequence brought by images, this work primarily focuses on RFT-like training methods, whose effectiveness and scalability have been well-documented in previous studies \\citep{yu2023metamath, yuan2023rft, tong2024dartmath, metallama3}.\n\n\n\n% In self-evolving training \\wl{or standard RFT?}, the design of reward functions can be adapted based on the specific training objective. For multimodal reasoning tasks, the reward function is defined as $\\mathcal{R}(y^*, \\hat{y}_i) =\\mathds{1}(y^* = \\hat{y}_i)$. Then the goal of Equation \\ref{eq:self_evolve} is to find an optimal policy model that maximizes the probability of generating correct sampled responses.\n\n% Although self-evolving training has been widely adopted and shown to be highly effective, it remains unclear what makes it work and how to design a good recipe for self-training, especially in complex scenarios like multimodal reasoning.

We begin by outlining the general setup (\\S \\ref{sec:setup}), followed by a comprehensive analysis of each component to identify the best practices for multimodal self-evolution (\\S \\ref{sec:training_methods}-\\S \\ref{sec:unlabeled}).\n\n\\subsection{General Setup}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\n\\textbf{Models}\nWe base our main exploration on MiniCPM-V-2.5 (8B) \\citep{yao2024minicpmv}, and we also validate the final design choice for each component on two extra models with different sizes: Phi-3.5-Vision (4B) \\citep{abdin2024phi} and InternVL-2 (2B) \\citep{chen2024internvl}. The details of these models can be found in Appendix \\ref{app:model_details}. To make the analysis process easier to understand, we mainly present the results of MiniCPM-V-2.5 in this section, while we include the results of the other models in \\S \\ref{sec:final_recipe}. \n% For ease of space, we mainly report the MiniCPM-V-2.5 results in the following analysis with full details,  of Phi-3.5-Vision and InternVL2-2B later in \\S \\ref{sec:final_recipe}.\n\n% \\jh{I have checked Table 5, actually the results of the other two models align with miniCPM-v-2.5, right? Then we can just say our exploration is on 3 models, it is just we only report minicpm in this section, but we include the full analysis results of the other two models later in section xxx. This way, I think we can introduce all three models somewhere in the appendix. Basically we don't need to make minicpm very special in the paper}MiniCPM-V-2.5 \\citep{yao2024minicpmv}, a powerful, openly released LMM. MiniCPM-V-2.5 leverages LLaMA-3-8B \\citep{metallama3} for its language model and SigLIP \\citep{siglip} as its vision encoder, resulting in strong multimodal capabilities. Its performance on a wide range of multimodal benchmarks significantly surpasses previous openly released LMMs such as LLaVA \\citep{liu2023llava,liu2024improvedllava} and Qwen-VL \\citep{Qwen-VL}. This superior performance makes MiniCPM-V-2.5 an ideal model for investigating self-evolving training in multimodal reasoning, with fewer risks of being constrained by the model's inherent capacities.\\jh{in this version, here we need to describe that although our controlled experiments are performed only using one model due to limited computing resources, in section xxx we demonstrate that our final recipe works well for multiple different vLMs on diverse benchmarks}\n% \\jh{How minicpm-v was trained is not that important to write here, instead what matters to be written here is (1) the size of this model; (2) use 1 or 2 sentences to express minicpm-v-2.5 has strong multimodal abilities, for example, outperform qwen-vl, llava, xxx (which are basically the main reason we chose it)}\n% \\jhc{Note that toconduct controlled experiments without the confounder of model,}\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Datasets}\n% \\jh{this section 3.1 is generally too long,  I think the Datasets and the Training and Evaluation paragraphs can be merged to be shorter. Some details can be moved to appendix}\nWe utilize MathV360K \\citep{shi2024mathllava}, a high-quality and diverse multimodal reasoning dataset as our seed training dataset.\n% that includes 40K human-curated examples and 320K synthetic samples generated by GPT-4V as our seed training dataset. The images and queries in this dataset span various subjects in multimodal reasoning including algebra, arithmetic, geometry, logic, numeric commonsense and science.\nSpecifically, we downsample half of the examples (180K) from it to serve as our labeled training set, while setting aside the remaining half as a unlabeled training set by not using the answers in it. \n% For the labeled set, each data sample is composed of $(x, o, a)$ without the intermediate thought process annotation, while for the unlabeled set we only have access to $(x, o)$. \n% This is a realistic setting as there are many multimodal SFT datasets with the final answer labels, but annotated thought processes are scarce. \nFor evaluation, we split 750 samples from the unlabeled part of MathV360K as the in-domain (ID) testset.\n% , using regular expression to extract and match the answers. \nFor our out-of-domain (OOD) testset we use the \\texttt{testmini} split of MathVista \\citep{lu2023mathvista}, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a wide range of multimodal reasoning tasks, including visual question answering, figure-based question answering, science question answering, and more. \n% We follow its original setting and use GPT-4 to extract and match the answers. \nWe also keep an non-overlapping 250 samples from MathV360K as the global validation set in training.\n% This is to mimic the setting where we have \n% The use of the remaining data will be further discussed in \n% Section \\ref{sec:unlabeled}.\n\n% \\paragraph{Warm-Up Phase to Unlock the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Capability of LMMs}\n\n% For the prompt during the warm-up phase, please refer to Appendix \\ref{app:prompt} for more details.\n\n% While diverse responses with various intermedia steps are crucial for self-evolving training, we \n\n\n\\textbf{Main Training Settings}\nBefore self-evolving training, a self-warmup stage (Appendix \\ref{app:prompt}) is applied to enhance the CoT generation ability of all models as many LLMs tend to output final answers directly without CoT.

During all rollout phases in training, we sample 16 responses per query and set the sampling temperature to 1.0. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we follow existing practices~\\citep{singh2023restem,zelikman2022star} and only use the labeled training data.\n\n% then we will study the impact of the unlabeled training data in \\textsection\\ref{sec:unlabeled}.\n% More details can be referred to Appendix~\\ref{app:hyperparam}.\n% \\jh{if we do not validate for mathvista and always use the same checkpoint for both mathv360k and mathvista, it is worth emphasizing that here which could make our ood results more impressive}\n% To balance effectiveness with training efficiency, \n% We set the maximum number of training steps as 10K for all experiments. \n% \\jh{I think we should mention some key hyperparams here, like k, and temperature?}For additional details, please refer to Appendix \\ref{app:hyperparam}. \n% \\wl{Should we mention constant scheduler here?

Therefore, we cluster the variations by three factors:}\nPrevious works mainly vary the model initialization factor, where at the ``Improve'' step,\n% \\jhc{(1) {\\bf Model initialization}: when training is performed at the ``Improve'' step,}{} \nthe model can be initialized from either the last checkpoint~\\citep{xu2024chatglm,pang2024iterative} or the beginning checkpoint before the first iteration~\\citep{zelikman2022star,singh2023restem}.\n% \\jhc{;}{\nBesides model initialization, in this work, we introduce new variants of iterative self-evolving through delving into the gap between iterative training and online RL -- concretely, when the iteration interval is small, the checkpoint at each iteration is initialized from one from the last iteration, and the optimizer as well as the learning rate scheduler is inherited between iterations, then iterative training becomes an online RL algorithm. \nTherefore, we propose {\\bf Continuous Self-Evolving}, a new iterative self-evolving training variant that represents a smoother interpolation between iterative training and online training. \nIn continuous self-evolving training, we inherit the optimizers as well as the learning rate schedulers from the last iteration besides inheriting the model checkpoint, so that the optimization is continuous and closer to purely online learning algorithms.   \n% }\n% \\jhc{\n% (2) {\\bf Iteration Interval}: while the common practice is to adopt a long iteration interval to process all the data queries for one iteration, we study the effect of having a shorter iteration interval, bringing it closer to online learning; and\n% (3) {\\bf Continuous Optimization}: we propose to inherit the optimizers as well as the learning rate schedulers from the last iteration besides inheriting the model checkpoint, so that the optimization is continuous and closer to purely online learning algorithms. }{} \nThis way, we only have a global optimizer and learning rate scheduler essentially across the entire iterative training process.\n% \\jhc{}{\nWe also analyze the \\emph{iteration interval} effect in continuous self-evolving, which is defined as the training queries passed for one iteration -- we specifically study the effect of having a shorter iteration interval, which stands in contrast to the common practice that adopts a long iteration interval to process all the data queries for one iteration.\n% }\n% \\jhc{We note that while the variation on model initialization has been studied before, the other two factors, iteration interval and continuous optimization, have been rarely discussed in previous implementations of iterative self-evolving training, and they turn out to be important empirically as we will show next. }{}\n% \\fan{small advice: maybe mention show in which section.}\n\n\n% the training method determines how data is processed and utilized to update the current policy model $\\pi^t_\\theta$ during self-evolving training. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning, which relies on static, \\textbf{offline} data curated by humans or models like GPT-4 \\citep{openai2023gpt4v}, self-evolving training emphasizes dynamic, \\textbf{online} data generation and exploitation. This online nature operates on two critical dimensions: data and learning. On the data dimension, the model samples from its own evolving policy, ensuring alignment with the current policy's behavior. On the learning side, the model continually trains from its current state—preserving ongoing training dynamics such as optimizer states—without resetting or reinitializing, mitigating distributional shifts and maintaining coherence with the evolving policy.\n\n% In this section, we explore the impact of these two dimensions—data sampling and learning dynamics—on the performance of self-evolving training. We begin by contrasting two paradigms: \\textbf{iterative} and \\textbf{online} learning. The iterative approach decouples data sampling from training, where the model samples data and then trains on it, either starting from an SFT model $\\pi_{\\theta_{sft}}$ or the current policy, without carrying over optimizer states or learning schedules. In contrast, the online paradigm integrates data sampling and training into a continuous process, maintaining the model's training state and ensuring ongoing alignment between learning and the evolving data distribution.\n\n\n\\textbf{Setup}\n% \\jh{across the paper, sometimes we have ``:'' after the paragraph title, sometimes we don't, please be consistent}\nWe perform controlled experiments to study the effect of different training methods, thus in this experiment we use the labeled dataset only and simply adopt the binary exact-match reward between ground-truth answer $a^*$ and the generated answer. \nWe compare with the most common iterative self-evolving algorithms ReST$^{EM}$~\\citep{singh2023restem} and iterative RFT, which are specific instantiations of our training methods design space. \n% \\jhc{To distinguish from the baselines, the variants with continuous optimization are named as \\emph{Continuous Self-Evolving}.}\n% {} \nTo study the effect of iteration interval in the proposed continuous self-evolving, we experiment with different percentage of all the queries per iteration, varying from [6.25\\%, 12.5\\%, 25\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%].\n% For iterative learning, we examine methods like ReST-EM \\citep{singh2023restem} and iterative RFT. In ReST-EM, training restarts from the SFT model at each iteration, while iterative RFT begins from the current policy model but reinitializes training dynamics at each iteration. On the other hand, the online paradigm, represented by online RFT, provides more efficient and scalable learning by continuously updating the model without resetting training states, making it particularly suitable for multimodal reasoning tasks.\n% From a data perspective, we analyze how varying the degree of online data sampling affects performance.\n% Specifically, we experiment with different rollout batch sizes for online RFT—[6.25\\%, 12.5\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%] of the dataset—to assess how the degree of online sampling influences the effectiveness of training in this evolving context.\n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{\n  % \\jh{the full results of mathvista will be useful on this table -- if we can still find it, plz record it.

Overall, initializing training from the last policy model checkpoint $\\pi_{\\theta}^t$ and maintaining a continuous optimization process contribute most significantly to the effectiveness of self-evolving training, particularly on MathVista. Continuous self-evolving achieves the best performance both on the in-domain MathV360K test set, with 43.1\\%, and on the OOD test set, MathVista, with 57.2\\%. We also see the importance of maintaining a proper interval to traverse the data queries. With a large interval, the training method becomes closer to an offline one, and the model cannot get timely updates on data matching its current output distribution. On the other hand, switching over the \\textit{Improve} and \\textit{Generate} steps too frequently makes the learning process unstable, leading to a lower score, especially on the in-domain test set. The strategy of continuous self-evolving with proper intervals also works for other smaller models, as shown in Table \\ref{tab:full_mathvista} compared with representative baselines, indicating its effectiveness and generalizability across different model sizes.\n\n% \\jl{Hope we can also add avg rollout utils here to indicate 45k is good for exploitation}\n\n% \\begin{table}[t!]\n%   \\centering\n%   \\caption{Experiments for Section 3.1 - Training Algorithm\\jh{Are the RestEM results from the same training steps or longer?}\\jh{maybe we should report on both benchmarks}\\jh{we should add the baseline results to the table (the initial performance before rft)}}\n%     \\begin{tabular}{llllrrrrr}\n%     \\toprule\n%     status &   Method   & ckpt  & optimizer & data per interval & perf & perf id & perf avg & Roll utils \\\\\n%     \\midrule\n%     finished (mbzui)  & IRT   & last  & new   & 100\\% (180K) & 55.7 & 42.6 & xx.x & \\\\\n%     finished (mbzui)  & RestEM & first & new   & 100\\% (180K) & xx.xx & xx.xx & xx.xx \\\\\n%     idle  & IRT global eval   & last  & new   & 100\\% (180K) & & & & \\\\\n%     idle  & RestEM global eval & first & new   & 100\\% (180K) & & & & \\\\\n%     \\midrule\n%     finished (mbzui) & \\multirow{5}[2]{*}{online RFT} & \\multirow{5}[2]{*}{last} & \\multirow{5}[2]{*}{last} & 100\\% (180K) & 56.7 & 42.2 & 49.45 & \\\\\n%     finished (mbzui)  &       &       &       & 50\\% (90K) & 56.2 & 43.1 & 49.65 &\\\\\n%     finished (mbzui) &       &       &       & 25\\%  (45K) & 57.2 & 43.1 & 50.15 & \\\\\n%     finished (mbzui) &       &       &       & 12.5\\% (22K) & 56.1 & 42.3 & 49.2 &\\\\\n%     finished (mbzui) &       &       &       & 6.25\\% (11K) & 56.8 & 41.0 & 48.9 &\\\\\n%     \\bottomrule\n%     \\end{tabular}%\n%   \\label{tab:addlabel}%\n% \\end{table}%\n\n% For online RFT, we experiment with different sampling intervals, using [6.25\\%, 12.5\\%, 25\\%, 50\\%, 100\\%] of the dataset in each iteration.\n\n% From the perspective of data dimension, we investigate how varying online degrees of data sampling in different \n\n% \\begin{table}[h!]\n%     \\centering\n%     \\begin{tabular}{llll|}\n%         \\hline\n%         \\textbf{Methods} & \\textbf{Data Source} & \\textbf{Reward Function} & \\textbf{Gradient Coefficient} \\\\\n%         \\hline\n%         SFT & $q, o \\sim P_{sft}(Q, O)$ & - & 1 \\\\\n%         \\hline\n%         \\multirow{2}{*}{RFT} & $q \\sim P_{sft}(Q), o \\sim \\pi_{sft}(O|q)$ & \\multirow{2}{*}{Rule} & Equation \\textcolor{red}{10} \\\\\n%         & & & \\\\\n%         \\hline\n%         \\multirow{2}{*}{DPO} & $q \\sim P_{sft}(Q), o^{+}, o^{-} \\sim \\pi_{sft}(O|q)$ & \\multirow{2}{*}{Rule} & Equation \\textcolor{red}{14} \\\\\n%         & & & \\\\\n%         \\hline\n%         \\multirow{2}{*}{Online RFT} & $q \\sim P_{sft}(Q), o \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}(O|q)$ & \\multirow{2}{*}{Rule} & Equation \\textcolor{red}{10} \\\\\n%         & & & \\\\\n%         \\hline\n%         \\multirow{2}{*}{PPO} & $q \\sim P_{sft}(Q), o \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}(O|q)$ & \\multirow{2}{*}{Model} & Equation \\textcolor{red}{18} \\\\\n%         & & & \\\\\n%         \\hline\n%         \\multirow{2}{*}{GRPO} & $q \\sim P_{sft}(Q), \\{ o_i \\}_{i=1}^{G} \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}(O|q)$ & \\multirow{2}{*}{Model} & Equation \\textcolor{red}{21} \\\\\n%         & & & \\\\\n%         \\hline\n%     \\end{tabular}\n%     \\caption{Methods comparison table}\n%     \\label{tab:methods}\n% \\end{table}\n\n% We split self-evolving training methods into two manners, iterative manners and online manners.

While effective, this sparse binary reward has limitations. It overlooks the quality of the intermediate reasoning steps within a response. Additionally, reward models trained from equal or higher capacity models than the policy model \\citep{fried2022incoder,wang2024mathshepherd,sun2024easy2hard} can provide richer signals to improve the policy model’s learning. \n\nIn this section, we introduce a Process Reward Model (PRM) \\citep{lightman2023let, wang2024mathshepherd}\n% \\jh{cite some PRM papers} \nfor multimodal reasoning—the first of its kind, to our knowledge—and explore how integrating PRM can enhance reward design and whether it can improve policy model learning in self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning. To incorporate the reward scores into the objective of self-evolving training, the reward function is reformulated as:\n% \\fan{equation shoule be numbered.}\n\\begin{align}\n&\\mathcal{R}(\\hat{y}_i) = \\mathcal{H}(\\mathds{1}(a^* = \\hat{a}_i)\\times \\mathcal{R}_p(\\hat{y}_i))\\\\\n&\\mathcal{R}_p(\\hat{y}_i) = \\min(f(s_{i}^0), f(s_{i}^1),..., f(s_{i}^m))\n\\end{align}\nHere, $\\mathcal{H}$ is an operation that processes responses based on the final reward scores, where we ensure all responses are correct by matching the ground truths,\n% \\jh{we need to explain here this definition means we have pre-filtering and all the responses must be correct on the labeled data.}\n and $\\mathcal{R}_p(\\hat{y}_i)$ represents the process reward score for each sampled response. The function $f(s_i^k)$ denotes the reward score at each intermediate step. Following \\citet{lightman2023let}, we use the $\\min$ operation to aggregate stepwise rewards.\n% ensuring that the overall reward reflects the lowest-scoring step in the reasoning process.\n\n% \\paragraph{Training Reward Models:}\n% \\jh{Please just use two or three sentences to describe how we train the reward models and move many details in this paragraph to appendix (even in appendix we don't need to describe math-shepherd in detail). We can just say we follow math-shepherd xxxx [two sentences on the high-level description of the approach].\n% We are not inventing this PRM training approach, thus we don't need to write this long to describe it. \n% If this is just two or three sentences, it could be merged into Setup paragraph.\n% }\n\n% To train our PRM, we first train another checkpoint \n% (denoted as $\\hat{\\pi}_{\\theta}^0$) on our CoT-augmented training data for a much longer period to make sure it fully converges. \n\n% Based on this model, we leverage Monte Carlo Rollut method~\\citep{wang2024mathshepherd} to collect the training data for PRM. Specially, we randomly pick 50K questions from the full training set, and sample 16 responses for each of them with $\\hat{\\pi}_{\\theta}^0$. We de-duplicate these responses, and only keep at most 4 responses for each question. After that we randomly sample 50K question-response pairs from all the pairs, where we control the ratio of correct and wrong responses as 1:1, and the ratio of multi-choice and free-form question as 1:1 as well, to keep a balanced distribution. \n\n% To construct the labels of each step, we use $\\hat{\\pi}_{\\theta}^0$ as the completer to complete the solution from the end of each step in one response. For the $k^{\\text{th}}$ step, the step label is annotated as $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N}{\\mathds{1}(C_j(s^{\\leq k})=a^*)}$, where $N (=16)$ is the number of completion, $C_j$ is the $j$-th completion.\n\n% Based on the stepwise annotations, we train our PRM from $\\hat{\\pi}_{\\theta}^0$. We initialize the linear reward model head as the average of the embeddings, and train with MSE loss on all tokens, where the label of each token is identical to the step end token. In experiments we freeze the visual encoder as we find it brings a slight improvement. \n% \\wl{It include too many training details consider to move sth to appendix}\n\n\\textbf{Setup}\nWe conduct controlled experiments to assess the impact of incorporating the Process Reward Model (PRM) into self-evolving training and explore how best to utilize it. Notably, before applying PRM, responses are pre-filtered based on their final answers to ensure consistency and quality during training. To train our PRM, we use Monte Carlo rollouts starting from prefixes with partial reasoning steps \\citep{wang2024mathshepherd} to generate the training data. Specifically, we sample 16 responses per question and complete each step 8 times to obtain step-level annotations and more details can be found in Appendix \\ref{app:prm}. We evaluate two different $\\mathcal{H}$ operations: (1) Top-K: Pick the top-K correct responses according to their reward scores, and (2) Filtering by a Threshold $\\alpha$: Filtering out sampled responses with lower aggregated rewards than $\\alpha$. The optimal value of $\\alpha$ is set $0.2$ by grid searching on the validation set. Additionally, we investigate how varying the value of $\\operatorname{K}$ in $\\operatorname{Top-K}$ affects training, as it represents a trade-off between the quality and diversity of the samples. According to \\textsection\\ref{sec:training_methods}, we fix training methods as continuous self-evolving with 45k interval and set continuous self-evolving, with or without randomly selected correct responses as our baselines.\n\n\\textbf{Results}\n% See Table \\ref{tab:sec33_main}\n% \\jh{We don't need to make miniCPM special since we have the full results of other two models.

Continuous Self-Evolving with PRM using $\\operatorname{Top-2}$ achieves the best performance in both the ID and OOD tests, with scores of 45.3\\% and 59.2\\%, respectively. Compared to training without PRM, most instances of self-evolving training with PRM show improved performance, especially in the OOD test. Interestingly, randomly selecting a subset of correct responses actually leads to worse performance than continuous self-evolving, suggesting that even correct answers can be noisy. Random selection may increase the proportion of these noisy samples, undermining the effectiveness of self-evolving training.\n\n% In terms of leveraging PRM, we found that using $\\operatorname{Top-K}$ with a moderate number of responses—a re-ranking operation to select $\\operatorname{K}$ correct responses with the highest-quality intermediate steps—outperforms filtering by a threshold.\nIn terms of leveraging PRM, we found that using $\\operatorname{Top-K}$ to select the a fixed number of best $\\operatorname{K}$ responses with high-quality intermediate steps outperforms threshold-based filtering.\nThe results also highlight the importance of balancing the quality and diversity of sampled responses. Selecting $\\operatorname{K}=2$ strikes this balance well, ensuring both response diversity and high-quality reasoning steps for each question. Similar to the results in \\S \\ref{sec:training_methods}, we also see improvement when involving PRM on smaller models in Table \\ref{tab:full_mathvista}, Appendix \\ref{ap:full_mathvista_analysis}.\n\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{The results of self-evolving training with PRM and different strategies to leverage reward scores. $\\mathcal{H}$ is the method to further pick out high-quality responses from the correct rollouts: (1) $\\operatorname{Top-k}$ is to select K correct responses with highest rewards, and (2) $>\\alpha$ is to pick out the correct responses with rewards larger than $\\alpha$.\n  % \\jh{what is Standard?

Based on the results from \\textsection\\ref{sec:rm}, we explore PRM’s impact from two key perspectives: (1) Can PRM help the model to select out correct responses among multiple rollouts? (2) How different are the Top 2 and the rest correct solutions re-ranked by reward scores? We use the first checkpoint after warmup $\\pi_\\theta^0$ as policy model to sample 16 responses for each question in the validation set with temperature=$1.0$ and reveal the behaviors of PRM in these samples. \n\nWe evaluate the verification ability of our PRM using two metrics, Best-of-N (BoN) and weighted voting \\citep{sun2024easy2hard}, which are commonly employed to assess the performance of reward models. Surprisingly, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:sec33rm_1}, our PRM underperforms in both metrics. Notably, BoN and weighted voting yield worse results than vanilla majority voting when $N<16$. We speculate that this is due to the lack of high-quality step-level annotations compared to text-only reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that our PRM is not an effective \\textbf{verifier}.\n\nTo understand why our PRM can still significantly contributes to self-evolving training despite its weaker verification abilities, we analyzed the distribution of other metrics for the top-2 selected responses compared to other correct responses. We approached this from two perspectives: the average number of reasoning steps, and how much a response is directly relevant to the question (see Appendix \\ref{app:gpt4orela}), since we do not find incorrect steps but find some irrelevant steps after randomly checking some examples.\nWe found the responses re-ranked by our PRM generally have \\textbf{fewer reasoning steps} (Figure \\ref{fig:rm_steps} in Appendix~\\ref{ap:dist_steps}) and \\textbf{more relevant to the query} (Figure~\\ref{fig:sec33rm_3}). This highlights the \\textbf{precision} of our PRM in recognizing genuinely high-quality responses. \n% While it may not rank all correct responses, it consistently selects those that are truly high quality, avoiding false positives. \nTherefore, our PRM acts as an effective \\textbf{reranker} to identify top-quality responses. This is especially critical when responses are already filtered by ground-truth answers, and the ability to accurately assess the quality of reasoning steps beyond accuracy becomes vital.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]  % 加入[htbp]，使图像更容易排布\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.23\\textwidth}\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]\n        {figures/sec3.3/MATHV360KEVAL250_temperature-1.0_acc.pdf}\n        \\caption{}\n        \\label{fig:sec33rm_1}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n    % \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\\textwidth}  % 设置每个子图的宽度为0.32\\textwidth\n    %     \\centering\n    %     \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth]{figures/sec3.3/rm_steps.pdf}\n    %     \\caption{}\n    %     \\label{fig:sec33rm_2}\n    % \\end{subfigure}\n    \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.23\\textwidth}  % 设置每个子图的宽度为0.32\\textwidth\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{figures/sec3.3/rm_relscore.pdf}\n        \\caption{}\n        \\label{fig:sec33rm_3}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n    \\caption{\n        \\textbf{(a)}: Accuracy on the val. set of greedy decoding and three selection strategy across different numbers of rollouts;\n        \\textbf{(b)}: Average relativity score annotated by GPT4-o of Top 2 and the rest responses re-ranked by rewards, we only calculate on correct ones.\n        % For distribution of average \\# of steps, please refer to Appendix~\\ref{ap:dist_steps} \\wl{move steps figure to appendix. fixed content in text parts}\n    }\n    \\label{fig:sec33rm_quality}\n    \\vspace{-15pt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n% As shown in Figures~\\ref{fig:sec33rm_2} and \\ref{fig:sec33rm_3},\n\n% \\jh{these are cool results! I wonder why we are thinking of scoring relativity rather than correctness like using gpt4-o as PRM (reviewers may wonder too)}\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned analysis, we also investigate why leveraging $\\alpha$ to filter responses with lower reward scores performs worse than $\\operatorname{Top-K}$. The results indicate that, even with the optimal threshold value determined from the validation set, it tends to either retain or filter out all responses for each query, which reduces diversity and makes the learning process more challenging. This further supports the conclusion that \\textbf{our PRM performs better as a Reranker than as a Verifier}.\n\n% we hypothesize ... According to ..., we find...  here for self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning.\n\n% In Figure \\ref{fig:sec33rm_quality} we find that our RM is unsuitable to be a verifier, but if we have already known several answers for a questions are correct, we can use the RM as a re-ranker to distinguish them.  \n\n% On the other hand, setting a threshold $\\theta$ is bad, since in most cases (130/181), the $\\theta$ we pick as the optimal one one on the dev set can not distinguish responses that are correct.\n\n% The goal of analysis in this section is to provide basic intuition why using RM is better than not, and why reranking is better than theta based.\n\n\n\n% Table generated by Excel2LaTeX from sheet 'Sheet1'\n% \\begin{table}\n%   \\centering\n%   \\caption{Experiments for Section 3.2 - Why and How to use RM, $\\theta^\\star$ is selected on the validation set: $\\theta^\\star=\\argmax_{\\theta} f_1(\\theta, M|D)$}\n%     \\begin{tabular}{llrrrr}\n%     \\toprule\n%     status & selection & \\multicolumn{1}{l}{num per query} & interval & perf & perf id\\\\\n%     \\midrule\n%     idle (from 3.1) & - & - & 45k & 57.2 & 43.1 \\\\\n%     finished (xiwen)  & random & 2 & & 55.5 & 41.0 \\\\\n%     running (mbzui)  & \\multirow{4}[0]{*}{rerank} & 1 & & 59.0 & 43.0  \\\\\n%     running (mbzui xiwen)  &       & 2 & $45k$ & 59.2 & 45.3 \\\\\n%     running (mbzui)  &       & 4 & & 58.4 & 44.0 \\\\\n%     idle  & threshold & $>\\theta^\\star$ & & 57.5 & 43.8\\\\\n%     \\bottomrule\n%     \\end{tabular}%\n%   \\label{tab:sec33_main}%\n% \\end{table}%\n% \\begin{table}\n%   \\centering\n%   \\caption{Experiments for Section 3.2 - Why and How to use RM, $\\theta^\\star$ is selected on the validation set: $\\theta^\\star=\\argmax_{\\theta} f_1(\\theta, M|D)$}\n%     \\begin{tabular}{llrrrr}\n%     \\toprule\n%     status & selection & \\multicolumn{1}{l}{num per query} & interval & perf & perf id\\\\\n%     \\midrule\n%     idle (from 3.1) & - & - & 45k & 57.2 & 43.4 \\\\\n%     finished (xiwen)  & random & 2 & & 55.5 & 41.0 \\\\\n%     running (mbzui)  & \\multirow{4}[0]{*}{rerank} & 1 & & 59.0 & 43.0  \\\\\n%     running (mbzui xiwen)  &       & 2 & $\\boldsymbol{45k}$ & 59.2 & 46.0 \\\\\n%     running (mbzui)  &       & 4 & & 58.4 & 45.9 \\\\\n%     idle  & threshold & $>\\theta^\\star$ & & 57.5 & 43.8\\\\\n%     \\bottomrule\n%     \\end{tabular}%\n%   \\label{tab:addlabel}%\n% \\end{table}%\n\n\n% \\begin{table}[htbp]\n%   \\centering\n%   \\caption{Experiments for Section 3.2}\n%     \\begin{tabular}{llllr}\n%     \\toprule\n%     status &       & ckpt  & optimizer & data per interval \\\\\n%     \\midrule\n%     idle  & IRT   & last  & new   & 100\\% (180K) \\\\\n%     idle  & IRT-plus & last  & last  & 100\\%+ (180K+) \\\\\n%     idle  & RestEM & first & new   & 100\\% (180K) \\\\\n%     \\midrule\n%     idle  & \\multirow{5}[2]{*}{online RFT} & \\multirow{5}[2]{*}{last} & \\multirow{5}[2]{*}{last} & 100\\% (180K) \\\\\n%     idle  &       &       &       & 50\\% (90K) \\\\\n%     idle  &       &       &       & 25\\%  (45K) \\\\\n%     idle  &       &       &       & 12.5\\% (22K) \\\\\n%     idle  &       &       &       & 6.25\\% (11K) \\\\\n%     \\bottomrule\n%     \\end{tabular}%\n%   \\label{tab:addlabel}%\n% \\end{table}%\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Prompt Variation}\n\\label{sec:unlabeled}\n% \\jh{as we discussed on slack, we study threshold and when to add the prompts?}\nIn this section, we explore how prompt variation affects self-evolving training. There are two primary types of prompts: labeled prompts and unlabeled prompts. Labeled prompts come with annotated ground truth answers, which can be used to filter out incorrect responses during training. In contrast, utilizing unlabeled prompts in self-evolving training is more challenging due to the absence of ground truth annotations. To maintain the quality of unlabeled prompts in training, surrogates like reward scores or pseudo labels must be employed. Meanwhile, unlike labeled prompts, unlabeled prompts are not be trained in SFT period, which increases the difficulty of learning for policy models. \n\n\\textbf{Skylines: Unlabeled Prompts with Oracle Reward Signals} The coupling of these additional factors introduces complexity, making the effective use of unlabeled prompts less predictable. Therefore we start by establishing a baseline with ``skyline\" experiments, where both the unlabeled prompts and their ground truth answers are available but not used during the SFT phase. These unlabeled prompts with oracle reward signals serve as an intermediate difficulty between fully unlabeled and labeled prompts, providing insight into the challenges of training with unlabeled data.\n\n\\textbf{Unlabeled Prompts} We incorporate unlabeled prompts into self-evolving training. To ensure the quality of sampled responses for these prompts, we use weighted voting to ensemble the predictions from different responses, treating the ensembled prediction as a pseudo label $\\Tilde{a}$. This pseudo label is then used to filter out responses with conflicting predictions, ensuring consistency. Following the best practices outlined in \\textsection\\ref{sec:rm}, we apply PRM as a reranker to select the top-2 responses with the predicted answer $\\Tilde{a}$. These unlabeled prompts are then mixed with labeled ones for self-evolving training. Additionally, since learning from unlabeled prompts is more challenging for policy models, we investigate the optimal timing to introduce them into training as well.\n% to better understand their impact on model performance. \nWe maintain an interval of 45k prompts and adjust when unlabeled prompts are introduced into the training process. Specifically, we introduce unlabeled prompts after [0\\%, 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%] of the total training process.\n% \\wl{Its clarity could be improved}\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{A Glimpse at Unlabeled Prompts: Potential Efforts to Make Them Effective} Table~\\ref{tab:unlabeled} presents the results of incorporating unlabeled prompts with and without oracle reward signals.\nWhen training relies solely on oracle reward signals without the PRM, continuous self-evolving with unlabeled prompts outperforms standard continuous self-evolving trained only on labeled prompts in the out-of-domain test but underperforms in the in-domain test. \nThis indicates that additional prompts help the model generalize better to underrepresented questions but also increase the risk of forgetting previously learned information. \nHowever, after combining with our PRM, all policy models perform worse than our best model trained exclusively on labeled prompts in both benchmarks, even when oracle reward signals are provided. \nBased on the analysis in \\textsection\\ref{sec:rm}, this occurs since our PRM is unable to verify responses without ground-truth answers, and its generalization remains a concern.\n% \\begin{wraptable}[16]{r}{6.0cm}\n\n% \\end{wraptable}%\n\n\\begin{table}[]\n  \\centering\n  % \\small\n  % \\vspace{-.5mm}\n  % \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{8pt}\n  \\caption{Results of involving unlabeled data. $T_{\\texttt{mixin}}$ denotes when to mixin the unlabeled data.

However, when unlabeled prompts are introduced later in the training process, they participate less in the overall training, leading to better results simply due to their limited involvement. This suggests that, without sufficient surrogate supervision (e.g., precise reward signals), introducing unlabeled prompts into self-evolving training can harm the process, potentially causing a deviation in the policy model's distribution.\n\n% skyline: we use unlabeled queries as labeled queries (w/ RM and w/o RM) (1:1, 2:1)\n\n% by default, we mix with an intuitive ratio in the beginning (optionally we can try add since the half)\n\n% We don't change the interval. \n\n% After this section, we have a temporary recipe for both w/ and w/o unlabeled data. \n\n% \\begin{itemize}\n%     \\item Other datasets: Oracle, PRM\n%     \\item Synthetic datasets\n% \\end{itemize}\n% Table generated by Excel2LaTeX from sheet 'Sheet1'\n% \\begin{wraptable}{t}{8cm}\n% \\begin{table}[t!]\n%   \\centering\n%   \\caption{Results on the involvement of unlabeled data. $T_{mixin}$ denotes the starting point to mixin the unlabeled data into the labeled data.

This shift in focus allows us to examine the process from an orthogonal angle, providing further insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive or impede progress in multimodal reasoning capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Monitoring the Training Dynamics}\n\\label{sec:monitor}\nIntuitively, two critical conditions must be met for the success of self-evolving training: (1) the presence of high-quality candidate responses generated by the model, otherwise self-evolving will not work no matter how strong the reward is; \n% For example, the model must be able to sample correct responses for the queries that the model cannot answer correctly with greedy decoding; \nand (2) the reward function's ability to effectively distinguish and prioritize these high-quality responses. These conditions align with the traditional reinforcement learning concepts of \\emph{exploration} and \\emph{exploitation}.\nApparently, both exploration and exploitation capabilities are dynamic targets in self-evolving training, as the policy model evolves and the distribution of rollout responses changes with each iteration. To better understand these training dynamics, we propose tracking and visualizing three metrics, where we introduce a novel metric, Reward-Pass@2, to monitor the exploration-expolitation trade-offs:\n% \\wl{passk - greedy has been removed}\n% \\fan{consider make the left indent smaller to save some line space}\n\\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]\n\n\\item \\emph{Greedy Accuracy}: the model's accuracy with greedy decoding. We track this metric for reference to compare with other metrics.\n\n\\item \\emph{Pass@K Accuracy}:  the percentage of samples for which the model produces at least one correct response when sampling $K$ candidates. This metric measures the model's exploration ability.\n\n    % \\item \\emph{(Pass@K - Greedy) Accuracy}: the difference between Pass@K and Greedy accuracy. Typically, Pass@K is an upper bound of Greedy Accuracy, and the gap roughly reflects the percentage of samples where the model, while failing in greedy decoding, can generate a correct response when sampling more candidates. This gap is crucial for the success of self-evolving training—a zero gap indicates that the model fails to explore correct responses for the current failure cases, suggesting that further training is unlikely to yield significant improvement.\n    \n\\item \\emph{Reward-Pass@2}: the ratio (\\%) of samples for which there exist correct responses among the top 2 responses ranked by the reward model. This metric directly reflects the exploitation efficacy of the reward model for the current policy. We choose Pass@2 since our training strategy involves selecting the top 2 responses using the reward model (\\textsection\\ref{sec:rm}).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n% \\footnote{We note that there is a slight mismatch between this metric and our training strategy as we use the ground-truth answer to pre-filter responses before the reward model reranks, and a more aligned metric to evaluate reward model should measure the reasoning quality of the top 2 responses both of which have correct answers. \n%     Given that there is no reliably way to score the quality of the thought processes, we regard Reward-Pass@2 as a reasonable approximation.\n%     }\n\n% In the self-evolution of (M)LLMs, both previous works and the discussions so far in this paper have focused on the \\textbf{exploitation} side, such as the use of RM as a Re-Ranker in Section \\ref{sec:rm}. However, we believe that encouraging \\textbf{exploration} is equally important, as exemplified by strategies in reinforcement learning like the $\\epsilon$-greedy method \\citep{sutton1999reinforcement}, Boltzmann distribution \\citep{cesa2006prediction}, or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) \\citep{auer2002finite}, which aim to try out new outputs and gather new feedback. Therefore, in this section, we investigate \\textbf{the dynamics of self-evolution}. For simplicity, we will limit our analysis to a single training run under the current optimal strategy, i.e., the online RFT, 25\\% query interval on labeled prompts, and with RM as re-ranker (Exp xx in Section \\ref ...

Perfect! I can see the prompts in the `PROMPT_TEMPLATES` dictionary. I can see there are two main types that match what the paper mentioned:

1. **Simple Prompt** (like "abel"): `"Question:\\n\{input\}\\nAnswer:\\nLet's think step by step.\\n"`
2. **Complex Prompt** (like "qwen-boxed"): `"<|im_start|>user\\n\{input\}\\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed\{\{\}\}.<|im_end|>\\n"`

\section{Model Prompt}

In our experiments, we use two types of prompts depending on the model's instruction-following capabilities. For models with weaker instruction-following abilities (Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-v0.1-7B, and Qwen-2.5-0.5B/1.5B), we employ simple prompts that require only step-by-step reasoning. For models with stronger instruction-following abilities, we use more complex prompts that require the final answers to be placed in boxes.

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what I've accomplished:

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task by adding the Simple Prompt and Complex Prompt sections to the appendix of your LaTeX paper. Here's what I did:

### 1. **Added the required color definition**
- Added `\definecolor\{lightProxYellow\}\{HTML\}\{ffbb00\}` to `main.tex` (line 25)
- This color matches the one used in M-STAR paper for consistent styling

### 2. **Replaced the TODO section in Appendix.tex**
- Located the TODO section at the end of the appendix
- Replaced it with a complete "Model Prompt" section that includes:
  - Explanatory text describing the two types of prompts used
  - Two `tcolorbox` environments styled exactly like M-STAR

### 3. **Created the prompt boxes**
- **Simple Prompt box**: Contains the "abel" prompt template from your codebase:
  ```
  Question:\\{input\}\Answer:\Let's think step by step.
  ```
- **Complex Prompt box**: Contains the "qwen-boxed" prompt template from your codebase:
  ```
  <|im_start|>system\You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\<|im_start|>user\\{input\}\Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed\{\}.<|im_end|>\<|im_start|>assistant
  ```

### 4. **Maintained exact styling from M-STAR**
- Used the same `tcolorbox` styling with `lightProxYellow` color scheme
- Same margins, frame style, and title formatting
- Used `\\` for line breaks as requested
- Preserved all existing formatting and colors

### 5. **Key features of the implementation**:
- ✅ Only edited the TODO section as requested
- ✅ No other parts of the paper were modified
- ✅ Used exact box style from M-STAR paper
- ✅ Proper package import (`tcolorbox` was already available)
- ✅ Consistent color definition added only where necessary
- ✅ Used actual prompts from your codebase
- ✅ Proper LaTeX formatting with `\\` for line breaks
- ✅ No file names were changed

The prompts are now displayed in professional-looking boxes that match the M-STAR paper's style, and readers can clearly see the difference between the simple and complex prompts used in your experiments.
