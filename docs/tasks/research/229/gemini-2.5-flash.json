You can find these needed prompts in our codebase. You only need to replace the text part of the box without modifying any style, color or fontsize etc, except that you must use '\\\\' for new lines, please just set the names of the boxes as `Simple Prompt` and `Complex Prompt`. You also need to handle proper package import and consistent color definition if necessary (this is the only edit you can make besides the TODO part). Do not change the file names in my paper project."

Each example in the MATH dataset is originally labeled with a difficulty level ranging from 1 to 5. In our experiments, we find that data difficulty is critical for successful zero RL (\\\\textsection\\\\ref{sec:data_complextiy_behaviur}) and it is necessary to use data that aligns with the model's capability. To investigate this phenomenon, we categorize the data into three difficulty levels: Easy (GSM8K and MATH lv.1), Medium (MATH lv.1\u20134), and Hard (MATH lv.3\u20135), with each category containing roughly 8,000 problems. \\nFor our main training runs, we use Easy for LLama-3.1-8B, Mistral- v0.1-7B, and DeepSeek-Math-7B; Medium for Qwen-2.5-0.5B; Hard for Mistral-Small-24B, Qwen-2.5-Math-7B, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B/7B/14B/32B, and we will report ablation study on data difficulty in \\\\textsection\\\\ref{sec:data_complextiy_behaviur}. \\n\\n\\n% \\\\label{sec:reward_remove}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Reward} \\n% \\\\label{sec:reward_remove}\\nWe use a rule-based reward function that assigns rewards solely based on the correctness of the generated response: a correct final answer receives a reward of +1, while an incorrect one receives a reward of 0. Recent studies~\\\\citep{deepscaler2025,chen2025empirical} often incorporate format-based rules into reward calculation, encouraging the model to follow specific output formats. However, we find that this approach may hinder the model's exploration and ultimately harm its performance particularly for the base models which struggle with following the format in the initial stage, as detailed in \\\\textsection\\\\ref{sec:remove_format}.\\n\\n% We also discuss the impact of incorporating format-based rewards on training in \\\\textsection\\\\ref{}.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Models} \\nWe conduct zero RL training experiments on Llama-3.1-8B~\\\\citep{dubey2024llama}, DeepSeek-Math-7B~\\\\citep{shao2024deepseekmath}, Mistral-v0.1-7B~\\\\citep{jiang2023mistral7b}, Mistral-Small-24b-Base-2501~\\\\citep{mistral2024small}, and Qwen-2.5 (0.5B, 1.5B, 7B, 14B, 32B)~\\\\citep{yang2024qwen2}.\\nAs we perform experiments for a variety of models, under extremely simple settings with small, simple datasets and only correctness reward, we refer to our obtained models as \\\\emph{SimpleRL-Zoo} to represent a simple training recipe for a zoo of open base models.\\nFor models with weaker instruction-following capabilities (Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-v0.1-7B, and Qwen-2.5-0.5B/1.5B), we employ simpler prompts~\\\\citep{abel} requiring only step-by-step reasoning. For models with stronger instruction-following abilities, we use more complex prompts~\\\\citep{yang2024qwen2} that require the final answers to be placed in boxes. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that using complex prompts with models that have weak instruction-following capabilities often results in large amounts of irrelevant or nonsensical content being generated early in training, leading to instability.\\nThe content of simpler prompts and more complex prompts is shown in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:prompt_case} in Appendix.\\n%% todo: add figure for this prompt\\n\\n\\n% \\\\begin{figure}[!t]\\n%         \\\\centering\\n% \\\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\\\columnwidth]{fig/Prompt_Case.pdf}\\n% \\\\caption{Comparison between simple prompts and more complex prompts.  \\\\yh{This figure can be smaller, or move to appendix. }      }\\n%         \\\\label{fig:prompt_case}\\n% \\\\end{figure}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Benchmark} \\nWe evaluate performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K~\\\\citep{cobbe2021training}, MATH 500~\\\\citep{hendrycks2021measuring}, Minerva Math~\\\\citep{lewkowycz2022solving}, and OlympiadBench~\\\\citep{he2024olympiadbench}, as well as on competition-level benchmarks such as AIME 2024 and AMC 2023. \\n% We also evaluate the generalization ability of zero RL training using three benchmarks: IFEVAL~\\\\citep{zhou2023instruction}, MMLU~\\\\citep{hendrycks2020measuring}, and GPQA-Diamond~\\\\citep{rein2024gpqa}. IFEVAL measures instruction-following capability, MMLU assesses the model's mastery of general knowledge, and GPQA-Diamond is a challenging benchmark that tests domain-specific expertise in chemistry, physics, and biology.\\n% \\\\jh{We also need to mention that we also test generalization, on xxx benchmarks}\\n% \\\\yh{\\n% \\\\subsection{Other Configurations:}\\n% % \\\\jh{I think we need to talk some important training/eval configs. for example, the rollout size (which is relevant to pass@k), the training max length and eval max length that we will mention again later, and mention we use verl [cite]. For some detailed configs that we want include in appendix (batch size, some GRPO hyperparams), we also need to cite that appendix here}\\n% We train our models using the verl~\\\\citep{sheng2024hybridflow} framework. We provide detailed training and evaluation details in the Appendix ~\\\\ref{sec:train_evaluate_details}.\\n% \\\\label{sec:train_evaluate_details}\\n% We typically use the same set of hyperparameters to train and evaluate all models in the SimpleRL-Zoo series in default main experiment setting.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Training and Evaluation Details}\\n\\n\\\\label{sec:train_evaluate_details}\\nWe train our models using the verl~\\\\citep{sheng2024hybridflow} framework. And we typically use the same set of hyperparameters to train and evaluate all models in the SimpleRL-Zoo series in default main experiment setting. We use a prompt batch size of 1,024 and generate 8 rollouts per prompt, with a maximum rollout length of 8,192 tokens. Training is performed using a mini-batch size of 256. The default sampling temperature is set to 1.0, and the clip ratio is 0.2. For models ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, we use a KL loss coefficient of 1e-4. For models larger than 14B, the KL loss coefficient is set to 1e-3. We build our evaluation script based on ~\\\\citet{yang2024qwen2math}, using a temperature of 1.0 and a maximum generation length of 16K tokens. To ensure consistency, we adopt the same prompt template used during training. For most benchmarks, we report pass@1 results. However, for AIME 2024, which contains fewer problems, we report both pass@1 and average accuracy (avg@32), computed over 32 generated samples per problem.\\n\\n\\\\section{Detailed Evaluation Metrics}\\n\\\\label{appx:eval_detail}\\n\\\\paragraph{Reasoning Behavior Ratio:} To better understand the model's reasoning patterns throughout the training process, we adopt the cognitive behavior framework proposed by ~\\\\citet{gandhi2025cognitive} and use GPT-4o~\\\\citep{hurst2024gpt} to identify reasoning-related behaviors, including ``Backtracking\\\", ``Verification\\\", ``Subgoal Setting\\\", and ``Enumeration\\\". \\nWe report the ratio of responses that contain such cognitive behaviors.\\nWhile some recent studies suggest tracking reflection behavior using related keywords~\\\\citep{yeo2025demystifying,xie2025logic} as monitoring signals, we argue that these keywords only exhibit only a weak correlation with high-level reasoning patterns like reflection and verification. As a result, they fail to adequately capture the development of these reasoning processes.  Further details can be found in Appendix~\\\\ref{appx:bahaviour}.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Clip Ratio:} In the early stages of training, the base model exhibits weak instruction-following ability and often fails to stop appropriately, resulting in irrelevant or excessively long outputs. After training collapses, the model may also generate repetitive or overly extended responses. Since the model has a fixed maximum context length, such outputs may be truncated during both training and evaluation. To monitor this issue, we define the proportion of truncated outputs as the ``Clip Ratio\\\".\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Average Stopped Length:} Generations that are truncated often result from issues such as repetitive patterns or incomplete reasoning, which typically do not contribute to effective trajectories. To account for this factor, we introduce a new metric to track the average length of responses that are stopped under normal conditions. It is a more reliable metric to consider only valid responses, thereby eliminating the interference caused by unstopped responses.\\n\\\\paragraph{Pass@k Accuracy:}\\nWe track the pass@k accuracy, which represents the percentage of questions for which at least one correct response is obtained when sampling k responses per question. Pass@k serves as an indicator of the model's exploration capabilities and is particularly relevant for RL, as it reflects the model's ability to generate responses that can achieve a positive reward. Previously, some researchers believed that RL training might merely reorder responses within the original model distribution, as evidenced by the lack of improvement in pass@k accuracy following RL training~\\\\citep{shao2024deepseekmath}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Detailed Result of SimpleRL}\\n\\\\label{appx:DetailedResult}\\nFollowing the setup described in Section~\\\\ref{sec:setup}, we perform ``zero training\\\" on various base models. The trained models are then evaluated on multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH 500, Minerva Math, OlympiadBench, AIME2024, and AMC2023. The average results across all these benchmarks are presented in Figures~\\\\ref{fig1:acc&len} and~\\\\ref{fig2:clip&stop}. In this section, we provide more detailed results.

Table~\\\\ref{tab:human_consistency} below presents the prediction rates and agreement rate. The prediction rate reflects how frequently each reasoning behavior is identified, while the agreement rate is the proportion of data on which the labelers (Human and GPT-4o) make the same prediction.\\n\\nOur results indicate a generally good level of agreement between GPT-4o and human annotations. However, GPT-4o tends to be more conservative when labeling certain behaviors such as Verification and Subgoal Setting. Upon closer examination, we observe that in cases with long CoT containing multiple reasoning behaviors, the model often favors labeling more obvious behaviors like Enumeration, while overlooking subtler ones.\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}[t]\\n    \\\\centering\\n\\\\resizebox{0.85\\\\textwidth}{!}{\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{llll}\\n\\\\hline\\n\\\\textbf{Behavior} & \\\\textbf{Score by GPT-4o (\\\\%)} & \\\\textbf{Score by Human (\\\\%)} & \\\\textbf{Raw Agreement (\\\\%)} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline\\nVerification      & 78.10\\\\% (82/105)              & 85.71\\\\% (90/105)             & 90.48\\\\% (95/105)            \\\\\\\\\\nBacktracking      & 33.33\\\\% (35/105)              & 35.24\\\\% (37/105)             & 98.10\\\\% (103/105)           \\\\\\\\\\nSubgoal Setting   & 66.67\\\\% (70/105)              & 74.29\\\\% (78/105)             & 90.48\\\\% (95/105)            \\\\\\\\\\nEnumeration       & 61.90\\\\% (65/105)              & 63.81\\\\% (67/105)             & 94.29\\\\% (99/105)            \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline\\n\\\\end{tabular}}\\n\\\\caption{The consistency between GPT-4o labeled reasoning behaviors and human annotations}\\n\\\\label{tab:human_consistency}\\n\\\\end{table}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Impact of General SFT on the Performance of Reinforcement Learning}\\\\label{sec:general_sft}\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}[t]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\small\\n    \\\\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}\\n    \\\\toprule\\n\\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Init Model}} & \\\\textbf{GSM8K} & \\\\textbf{\\\\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}MATH \\\\\\\\ 500\\\\end{tabular}} & \\\\textbf{\\\\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Minerva \\\\\\\\ Math\\\\end{tabular}} & \\\\textbf{\\\\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Olympiad\\\\\\\\ Bench\\\\end{tabular}} & \\\\textbf{\\\\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}AIME24 \\\\\\\\ (pass@1)\\\\end{tabular}} & \\\\textbf{AMC23} & \\\\textbf{Avg.} \\\\\\\\ \\\\midrule\\n0 Step & 92.0 & 70.6 & 36.8 & 36.6 & 16.7 & 45.0 & 49.6 \\\\\\\\\\n10 Step & 93.0 & 69.4 & 39.7 & 32.3 & 10.4 & 44.1 & 48.2 \\\\\\\\\\n20 Step & 92.6 & 65.2 & 34.2 & 30.7 & 6.7 & 38.4 & 44.6 \\\\\\\\\\n200 Step & 90.3 & 59.0 & 31.6 & 23.3 & 2.1 & 26.9 & 38.9 \\\\\\\\\\n1000 Step & 88.9 & 48.8 & 27.6 & 20.7 & 2.5 & 18.1 & 34.4 \\\\\\\\\\n2000 Step & 89.8 & 49.0 & 23.2 & 18.1 & 0.8 & 20.3 & 33.5 \\\\\\\\\\n4000 Step & 87.7 & 52.0 & 23.5 & 17.2 & 2.1 & 21.6 & 34.0 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\bottomrule\\n\\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\caption{Experimental results from multiple Mistral-Small-24B models, each fine-tuned with a different number of SFT steps on a general SFT dataset for RL.

In this setup, we first conducted SFT on Mistral-Small-24B using the widely adopted OpenHermes-2.5 dataset.\\\\footnote{\\\\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5}} We implement with LLaMA-Factory~\\\\citep{zheng-etal-2024-llamafactory} and adopt common hyperparameters of SFT, including 512 examples per batch with a constant learning rate of 1e-5. For consistency with our other experiments, we fine-tuned the model using the Qwen chat template.\\nAfter SFT, we preserved multiple checkpoints at different training steps, and nearly 800 steps correspond to 1 epochs on the SFT dataset. We then performed reinforcement learning on these models using identical hyperparameters as in our zero-RL training experiments.\\n\\nTable~\\\\ref{tab:general_sft_results} presents our findings, with performance reported as the best results achieved during RL training up to 100 iterations. The results demonstrate an inverse relationship between SFT steps and subsequent RL performance: models with more SFT steps showed diminished performance after RL training. While the average performance after 10 SFT steps remained comparable to the base model, it still exhibited some negative effects. More significantly, models with more than 20 steps showed substantially reduced RL potential.\\nTherefore, we conclude that RL training produces the best performance gain when applied directly to the base model without any supervised fine-tuning, i.e., the zero RL training.\\n\\n\\\\section{Impact of Exploration-Related Hyperparameters}\\n\\\\label{sec:impact_explore_hyper}\\nIn this section, we examine the effects of exploration-related hyperparameters on \\\"zero-training.\\\" Drawing inspiration from ~\\\\citet{zeng2024b,liu2024diving}, we focus on two key factors: sampling size (the number of responses per query) and sampling temperature.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Sampling Size:} We examine how varying sampling sizes $N \\\\in \\\\{1,4,8,16,32\\\\}$ influence the training process using the Mistral 24B model; these results are presented in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:sampling_number}. Our analysis reveals a clear trend: as $N$ increases, the model's average performance notably improves, and variability in response lengths becomes significantly more stable. For example, after 100 training steps, the scenario with $N=32$ achieves an average accuracy approximately 6 points higher than that with $N=8$. Conversely, smaller sampling sizes ($N=1$ and $N=4$) cause training instability and potential collapse, indicated by rapid growth in generated length without corresponding accuracy improvements. We hypothesize that larger sample sizes enable the model to explore a broader and more diverse training space, which stabilizes advantage estimation and sustains continuous performance improvement.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[!t]\\n        \\\\centering\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\\\columnwidth]{fig/plot_figure8_v3_diff_n-mistral-24b}\\n\\\\caption{Comparison of accuracy and response length using different sampling numbers N = 1, 4, 8, 32.

The results, presented in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:train_sample_temperature} , indicate that training with higher temperatures generally leads to better average performance. For instance, models trained with temperatures of 1.0 and 1.2 outperform those trained with 0.8 and 0.6. Additionally, we find that the optimal evaluation temperature depends on the training temperature. Specifically, models trained at higher temperatures require higher sampling temperatures during evaluation, as using greedy sampling often results in repetitive outputs. Conversely, models trained at lower temperatures perform best when evaluated with lower sampling temperatures.\\n\\n\\\\section{SimpleRL-Zoo For Qwen2.5-Math-7B}\\nIn this section, we conduct experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B~\\\\citep{yang2024qwen2} using the ``hard part\\\" data, as described in \\\\S~\\\\ref{sec:setup}, which consists of only 8K examples from MATH lv3-5. We apply both the PPO and GRPO algorithms to train our base model, and the overall evaluation results across training steps are shown in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:qwen-math}. The final performance and response length for both algorithms converge to similar values, with GRPO slightly outperforming PPO. While the performance continues to improve, the response length does not exhibit a similar trend. Specifically, the stopping length for both algorithms remains relatively unchanged, and fluctuations in the average response length are primarily attributed to changes in the clip ratio. There are two main reasons for this behavior: First, the maximum context length for Qwen2.5-Math-7B is 4K, which is limited compared to other models with context lengths exceeding 8K, leading to a high clip ratio. Second, as a math-specific model, Qwen2.5-Math-7B already performs very well on MATH, the dataset we used for training, so it may not face enough challenge to further extend its response length. Therefore, we hypothesize that more challenging data might be needed to push this capable model further.\\n\\\\begin{figure*}[]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\subfigure{\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\\\textwidth]{fig/plot_appx_figure3_v1_ppo_grpo-qwen-2.5-math.pdf}\\n    }\\n    \\\\subfigure{\\n        \\\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\\\textwidth]{fig/plot_appx_figure4_v1_ppo_grpo-clip-ratio-stop-tokens-qwen-2.5-math.pdf}\\n    } \\\\vspace{-10pt}\\n    \\\\caption{Comparison of accuracy and response length between PPO and GRPO on Qwen2.5-Math-7B.

The first method tracks the occurrence of specific keywords in the model's responses, such as \\\"recheck,\\\" \\\"rethink,\\\" \\\"try again,\\\" \\\"wait,\\\" \\\"alternatively,\\\" \\\"retry,\\\" and \\\"however.\\\" The second method employs ~\\\\citep{gandhi2025cognitive}'s cognitive framework for evaluation. Figure~\\\\ref{fig:method_reasoning_behaviors} illustrates the observed changes in reasoning behavior according to these two approaches. During the training process, we observe that the proportion of specified keywords in the DeepSeek math model's responses remains consistently low, exhibiting minimal variation. Conversely, reasoning behaviors identified by the cognitive framework demonstrate a significant upward trend.\\n\\nTo understand this intriguing discrepancy, we manually review the reasoning behaviors recorded by the cognitive framework. Our analysis reveals that many of these reasoning behaviors do not necessarily involve the predefined keywords. For instance, in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:deepseekmath_backtracking.png}, the observed reasoning behaviors include Verification and Backtracking, neither of which contains the specified keywords. This indicates that keywords alone cannot effectively distinguish or capture the nuanced differences between such behaviors. Similarly, in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:deepseekmath_base_verification}, the reasoning process involves implicit verification steps, including recalculating intermediate results such as the dot product and magnitudes before determining the cosine of the angle. Again, these subtle verification steps are not represented by the designated keywords. In Figure~\\\\ref{fig:deepseekmath_base_enumeration}, the reasoning involves considering multiple possible scenarios or outcomes. This type of exploratory reasoning is also inadequately captured by keyword-based approaches.\\nThese examples collectively illustrate that relying solely on keyword presence is insufficient for accurately identifying and differentiating complex reasoning behaviors within model responses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[!t]\\n        \\\\centering\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\columnwidth]{fig/deepseek-math-backtracking.pdf}\\n\\\\caption{A comparison of DeepSeek-Math-7B\u2019s ``Backtracking\\\" behavior before and after zero RL training.
