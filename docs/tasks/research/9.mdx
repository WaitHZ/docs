# # Publications markdown generator for academicpages
# 
# Takes a TSV of publications with metadata and converts them for use with [academicpages.github.io](academicpages.github.io). This is an interactive Jupyter notebook, with the core python code in publications.py. Run either from the `markdown_generator` folder after replacing `publications.tsv` with one that fits your format.
# 
# TODO: Make this work with BibTex and other databases of citations, rather than Stuart's non-standard TSV format and citation style.
# 

# ## Data format
# 
# The TSV needs to have the following columns: pub_date, title, venue, excerpt, citation, site_url, and paper_url, with a header at the top. 
# 
# - `excerpt` and `paper_url` can be blank, but the others must have values. 
# - `pub_date` must be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
# - `url_slug` will be the descriptive part of the .md file and the permalink URL for the page about the paper. The .md file will be `YYYY-MM-DD-[url_slug].md` and the permalink will be `https://[yourdomain]/publications/YYYY-MM-DD-[url_slug]`


# ## Import pandas
# 
# We are using the very handy pandas library for dataframes.

# In[2]:

import pandas as pd


# ## Import TSV
# 
# Pandas makes this easy with the read_csv function. We are using a TSV, so we specify the separator as a tab, or `\t`.
# 
# I found it important to put this data in a tab-separated values format, because there are a lot of commas in this kind of data and comma-separated values can get messed up. However, you can modify the import statement, as pandas also has read_excel(), read_json(), and others.

# In[3]:

publications = pd.read_csv("publications.tsv", sep="\t", header=0)
publications


# ## Escape special characters
# 
# YAML is very picky about how it takes a valid string, so we are replacing single and double quotes (and ampersands) with their HTML encoded equivilents. This makes them look not so readable in raw format, but they are parsed and rendered nicely.

# In[4]:

html_escape_table = {
    "&": "&amp;",
    '"': "&quot;",
    "'": "&apos;"
    }

def html_escape(text):
    """Produce entities within text."""
    return "".join(html_escape_table.get(c,c) for c in text)


# ## Creating the markdown files
# 
# This is where the heavy lifting is done. This loops through all the rows in the TSV dataframe, then starts to concatentate a big string (md) that contains the markdown for each type. It does the YAML metadata first, then does the description for the individual page. If you don't want something to appear (like the "Recommended citation")

# In[5]:

We aim to provide a new comprehensive global model for\nthe formation of companions via DI. The latter leads for the companions to\norbital migration and damping of the eccentricities and inclinations. As it\nevolves, the disc is continuously monitored for self-gravity and fragmentation.\nWhen the conditions are satisfied, one (or several) clumps are inserted. The\nevolution of the clumps is then followed in detail. We showcased the model by\nperforming a number of simulations for various initial conditions, from simple\nnon-fragmenting systems to complex systems with many fragments. We confirm that\nthe DIPSY model is a comprehensive and versatile global model of companion\nformation via DI. It enables studies of the formation of companions with\nplanetary to low stellar masses around primaries with final masses that range\nfrom the brown dwarf to the B-star regime. We conclude that it is necessary to\nconsider the many interconnected processes such as gas accretion, orbital\nmigration, and N-body interactions, as they strongly influence the inferred\npopulation of forming objects. It is also clear that model assumptions play a\nkey role in the determination of the systems undergoing formation.",

We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet\nSurvey Satellite (TESS) and published radial velocities to determine the\nphysical properties of the component stars. We find masses of 2.098 +/- 0.021\nMsun and 2.091 +/- 0.018 Msun, and radii of 2.179 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 2.139 +/-\n0.007 Rsun. The measured distance to the system is affected by the light from a\nnearby companion star; we obtain 178.4 +/- 2.5 pc. The properties of the system\nare best matched by theoretical predictions for a subsolar metallicity of Z =\n0.010 and an age of 570 Myr. We measure seven significant pulsation frequencies\nfrom the light curve, six of which are consistent with delta Scuti pulsations\nand one of which is likely of slowly-pulsating B-star type.",

Effective temperature (Teff=14,500) and gravity\n(log g=3.79) suggest that the star is close to terminating hydrogen burning. An\nanalysis of the spectral energy distribution allowed us to determine the\nangular diameter as well as the interstellar reddening. Using evolutionary\nmodels from the MIST database we derived the stellar mass (4.75Msun) and age\n(104^+11_-13 Myr). The spectroscopic distance (4.17 kpc), the radius (4.5\nRsun), and the luminosity (log(L/Lsun)=2.89) then result from the atmospheric\nparameters. Using Gaia proper motions, the trajectory is traced back to the\nGalactic disk to identify the place of birth in a spiral arm. The ejection\nvelocity of 92 km s^{-1} is typical for runaway stars in the halo. The age of\nthe star is larger than its time of flight (78+-4 Myr), which favors a binary\nsupernova event as the likely ejection mechanism. The TESS light curve shows\nvariations with a period of 3.58 days from which we conclude that it is a\nslowly pulsating B-star, one of very few run-away B-stars known to pulsate.",

      "abstract": "In the absence of extensive human-annotated data for complex reasoning tasks,\nself-improvement -- where models are trained on their own outputs -- has\nemerged as a primary method for enhancing performance. However, the critical\nfactors underlying the mechanism of these iterative self-improving methods\nremain poorly understood, such as under what conditions self-improvement is\neffective, and what are the bottlenecks in the current iterations. In this\nwork, we identify and propose methods to monitor two pivotal factors in this\niterative process: (1) the model's ability to generate sufficiently diverse\nresponses (exploration); and (2) the effectiveness of external rewards in\ndistinguishing high-quality candidates from lower-quality ones (exploitation).\nUsing mathematical reasoning as a case study, we begin with a quantitative\nanalysis to track the dynamics of exploration and exploitation, discovering\nthat a model's exploratory capabilities rapidly deteriorate over iterations,\nand the effectiveness of exploiting external rewards diminishes as well.\nMotivated by these findings, we introduce B-STaR, a Self-Taught Reasoning\nframework that autonomously adjusts configurations across iterations to Balance\nexploration and exploitation, thereby optimizing the self-improving\neffectiveness based on the current policy model and available rewards. Our\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and commonsense reasoning\ndemonstrate that B-STaR not only enhances the model's exploratory capabilities\nthroughout training but also achieves a more effective balance between\nexploration and exploitation, leading to superior performance.",

However, the evolution and\nfate of the most luminous RSGs is uncertain. Observational evidence for\nluminous warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of luminous RSGs as supernova\nprogenitors suggest a blueward evolution. In this work, we analyze WOH G64,\nconsidered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic\nCloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series\nphotometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from\nsemi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy\nconfirms the transition, as WOH~G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in\nthe optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We discovered that\nWOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned\nto a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be\nexplained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the\nreturn of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding\n30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind\nphase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH~G64 offers a unique opportunity\nto witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the\nfinal phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.",

The masses of these companions are straddling the\n~13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit but their mass ratio with respect to\ntheir host star is close to that of Jupiter. We derive a frequency of such\nmassive planetary mass companions around B stars of 11-5+7%, accounting for the\nsurvey sensitivity.

The binaries were subjected\nboth to stellar evolution and dynamical encounters with other stars in the\ncluster. The dynamical cluster environment results in a higher binary fraction\namong the Cepheids that remain in star clusters ($\\approx 60$%) than among the\nCepheids which have escaped to the field ($\\approx 35$%).

Approximately $40$ % of Cepheids have merged with their companion,\nand the merger event impacts stellar evolution; the age of Cepheids expected\nfrom their mass can differ from the age of their host cluster. Our models\npredict that one in five Cepheids is the result of a merger between stars with\nmass below the lower mass limit for Cepheids; in clusters, these objects occur\nsubstantially later than expected from their mass.

To help distinguish these\nfrom genuine companions, multi-epoch astrometry can be used to identify a\ncommon proper motion with the host star. Although this is frequently done, many\napproaches lack an appropriate model for the motions of the background\npopulation, or do not use a statistical framework to properly quantify the\nresults. Here we use Gaia astrometry combined with 2MASS photometry to model\nthe parallax and proper motion distributions of field stars around exoplanet\nhost stars as a function of candidate magnitude. We develop a likelihood-based\nmethod that compares the positions of a candidate at multiple epochs with the\npositions expected under both this field star model and a co-moving companion\nmodel. Our method propagates the covariances in the Gaia astrometry and the\ncandidate positions. True companions are assumed to have long periods compared\nto the observational baseline, so we currently neglect orbital motion. We apply\nour method to a sample of 23 host stars with 263 candidates identified in the\nB-Star Exoplanet Abundance Study (BEAST) survey on VLT/SPHERE. We identify\nseven candidates in which the odds ratio favours the co-moving companion model\nby a factor of 100 or more. Most of these detections are based on only two or\nthree epochs separated by less than three years, so further epochs should be\nobtained to reassess the companion probabilities.

Most recent efforts to\nreproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series,\nwhich may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit\nstrong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we\ninvestigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different\nfamilies and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B,\nQwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several\nkey design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query\ndifficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and\nresponse length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the\ntraining dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct\npatterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not\nalways correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as\nverification (i.e., the \"aha moment\"). Notably, we observe the \"aha moment\" for\nthe first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key\ndesigns that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and\npractices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and\nanalysis tools.",

Recently, the approach to selfimprovement has shifted toward a more dynamic, online fashion through iterative\ntraining. However, the critical factors underlying the mechanism of these iterative\nself-improving methods remain poorly understood, such as under what conditions\nself-improvement is effective, and what are the bottlenecks in the current iterations.\nIn this work, we identify and propose methods to monitor two pivotal factors\nin this iterative process: (1) the model\u2019s ability to generate sufficiently diverse\nresponses ( *exploration* ); and (2) the effectiveness of external rewards in distinguishing high-quality candidates from lower-quality ones ( *exploitation* ). These factors\nare inherently dynamic throughout the iterative process, yet prior research rarely\ndiscusses their evolution \u2013 leaving unclear why models often stagnate after only\na few iterations. Using mathematical reasoning as a case study, we begin with a\nquantitative analysis to track the dynamics of exploration and exploitation, discovering that a model\u2019s exploratory capabilities rapidly deteriorate over iterations,\nand the effectiveness of exploiting external rewards diminishes as well. Motivated\nby these findings, we introduce B-ST A R, a **S** elf- **Ta** ught **R** easoning framework\nthat autonomously adjusts configurations across iterations to **B** alance exploration\nand exploitation, thereby optimizing the self-improving effectiveness based on the\ncurrent policy model and available rewards. Our experiments on mathematical\nreasoning, coding, and commonsense reasoning demonstrate that B-ST A R not only\nenhances the model\u2019s exploratory capabilities throughout training but also achieves\na more effective balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to superior\nperformance. Crucially, this work deconstructs the opaque nature of self-training\nalgorithms, providing interpretable insights into their dynamics and highlighting\ncurrent limitations to guide future research. [1]\n\n1 I NTRODUCTION\n\nLarge language models possess advanced reasoning capabilities such as mathematical problemsolving (Cobbe et al., 2021), coding challenges (Chen et al., 2021) or commonsense reasoning\n(Clark et al., 2018). However, the challenge of acquiring extensive, high-quality human-curated\ndatasets remains a significant barrier to further enhancing these reasoning abilities. As tasks grow in\ncomplexity, the reliance on human-generated data becomes increasingly unsustainable, necessitating\nalternative approaches to training.\n\nTo tackle this issue, methods rooted in the concept of \u201cself-improvement\u201d (Huang et al., 2022),\nsuch as STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022), RFT (Yuan et al., 2023), and ReST (Gulcehre et al., 2023;\nSingh et al., 2023), provide more cost-effective and scalable solutions. Self-improvement follows an\niterative process where the model generates responses, from which the better are selected to create\n\n*\u2217* Equal Contribution.\n1 [We open-source our code at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/B-STaR.](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/B-STaR)\n\n1\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\n\n|0|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n|0 200 4|0 200 4|SFT<br>Online<br>STaR/R<br>Iterativ<br>B-STaR<br>00 600|\n\n\n(c) APPS\n\n\n|3|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n|0 200 4|0 200 4|SFT<br>Online<br>STaR/R<br>Iterati<br>B-STaR<br>00 600|\n\n\n(d) ARC-C\n\n\n(b) MATH\n\n\n\n(a) GSM8K\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Pass@1 accuracy over training steps on GSM8K, MATH, APPS, and ARC-Challenge.

For further details on the experimental settings, please refer to \u00a74.1.\n\nhigher-quality data for further refinement (Hosseini et al., 2024). This continuous loop allows the\nmodel to improve its performance over time, reducing the need for large amounts of human-generated\ndata. Ultimately, this approach enhances the model\u2019s ability to handle complex reasoning tasks,\npushing the limits of its capabilities (Havrilla et al., 2024).\n\nDespite significant advancements, we still lack a deep understanding of the key factors that drive\nsuccessful self-improvement and the internal optimization mechanisms remain largely opaque. Understanding the critical components and bottlenecks of these self-improving methods is particularly\nimportant given that performance of current self-improving approaches does not scale well with\nincreased compute and saturates very quickly after merely 3 to 5 iterations (Singh et al., 2023; Wu\net al., 2024). In this paper, we address the following questions: (1) What key factors play a decisive\nrole in the self-improvement process? (2) How can these factors be used to analyze the limitations of\ncurrent self-improvement methods from a unified perspective? and (3) How can we leverage these\nfactors to guide the self-improvement process, ultimately maximizing performance gains?\n\nTo this end, we identify two crucial capabilities of the model during its self-improvement process: (1)\nExploration \u2013 the model\u2019s ability to generate correct and diverse responses among multiple generated\ncandidates (Singh et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a), and (2) Exploitation \u2013 the effectiveness of external\nrewards (e.g., a reward model or final answer supervision) in selecting high-quality solutions from\nthese candidates (Wang et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2024). Intuitively, these two factors are dynamic,\nevolving throughout the training process, a phenomenon that remains underexplored despite its\ncritical importance. In this work, we first conduct empirical analysis to quantitatively monitor the\ndynamics of exploration and exploitation during iterative training processes. We observe that both\ncapabilities may stagnate or even decline, and imbalances between them can hinder the model\u2019s\nongoing improvement.\n\nMotivated by these insights, we propose a novel approach for self-improvement that automatically\nmonitors and balances these dynamic factors to optimize the use of the current policy and reward.\nThis involves adjusting configurations that influence exploration and exploitation, such as sampling\ntemperature and reward thresholds. These configurations are adaptively modified throughout training\nin terms of our proposed metric, *balance score* . This new metric assesses the potential of a query\nbased on the current model\u2019s exploration and exploitation capabilities, and our method automatically\nbalances exploration and exploitation behaviors to maximize the average balance scores. We refer to\nthis method as B-ST A R, a Balanced Self-Taught Reasoner.\n\nThe experimental results from mathematical problem-solving, coding challenges and commonsense\nreasoning demonstrate that B-ST A R significantly surpasses other self-improvement methods through\nbalanced exploration and exploitation. For instance, B-ST A R achieves a significant improvement in\nPass@1 on both GSM8K and MATH, surpassing various self-improving variants while maintaining\na steady upward trajectory, as depicted in Figure 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explorationrelated metrics, such as Pass@32, are continuously improving without any notable degradation.\n\n2\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the B-ST A R approach. In each iteration, we first identify the configurations \u2013 temperature\n*t* *i* and reward threshold *\u03c4* *i* \u2013 that maximize the average balance scores using a small subset of training queries.\nNext, we apply the optimal temperature and threshold to generate and reward the full set of training queries.\nFinally, we update the model based on the selected data.\n\n2 M ONITORING E XPLORATION AND E XPLOITATION IN S ELF -I MPROVEMENT\n\n2.1 B ACKGROUND : S ELF -I MPROVEMENT\n\nGiven a pre-trained model *P* 0 and a training set *D* = ( *x* *i* *, y* *i* ) *[N]* *i* =1 [, where] *[ x]* *[i]* [ denotes the training]\nquery and *y* *i* represents the response, the goal of self-improvement is to iteratively generate highquality responses from the current model and update the model with these self-generated data. Let *T*\nrepresent the total number of iterations, with the model at the start of the *t* -th iteration denoted as\n*P* *t\u2212* 1 . In the first iteration, *P* 0 is typically fine-tuned on the initial dataset *D*, then each subsequent\niteration involves three critical steps generally (Yuan et al., 2023; Gulcehre et al., 2023):\n\n(1) Generating (Sampling): For each query *x* *i*, the model *P* *t\u2212* 1 generates *K* candidate responses,\nforming a new, self-generated dataset.\n\n(2) Rewarding (Verifying): A reward function *r* ( *x, y* ) is applied to score and select the high-quality\nresponses from the self-generated dataset. This reward can be binary and utilize additional supervision,\nfor example, in problem-solving tasks in the math and code domains, it is common to use the final\nanswer matching or the result of passing unit tests as binary feedback (Yuan et al., 2023; Chen et al.,\n2022). In a more sophisticated case, *r* ( *x, y* ) can be parameterized by a reward model outputting\ncontinuous scores, using outcome-based reward models (ORMs) (Li et al., 2022) or process-based\nreward models (PRMs) (Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Havrilla et al., 2024).\n\n(3) Improving: The selected dataset is used to update *P* *t\u2212* 1, producing *P* *t* . To differentiate the\ngeneration model *M* from the reward model, *M* is also referred to as the policy model following\nRL literature. In reasoning tasks that we are going to focus on, SFT loss is commonly used in the\nImproving step due to its robustness and scalability (Pang et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024), as more\nsophisticated RL losses can be unstable to optimize and scale up. When SFT loss is adopted, the\nRewarding step aims to reject low-quality responses and use remaining high-quality data for training,\nthus this process is also referred to as rejection fine-tuning (RFT, Yuan et al. (2023)). In Appendix C,\nwe provide detailed explanations of self-improvement, including reward functions and RFT.\n\n**Discussion on Online Learning.** The iterative procedure described above can be contextualized\nwithin the reinforcement learning framework (Singh et al., 2023), and the iterative design shifts the\nvanilla offline training towards a more dynamic online variant \u2013 when iteration intervals are short and\nthe optimizer is inherited between iterations, the training essentially transforms into a fully online\nlearning algorithm. Iterative RFT implementations in previous works typically adopt long iteration\nintervals where each iteration processes all available queries (Zelikman et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024).\nSometimes, these implementations opted to restart the training from the initial checkpoint rather than\nfrom the last saved model (Zelikman et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2023). However, we argue that always\nstarting from the beginning is not scalable for large datasets, particularly in a streaming setting,\ninstead, a continuous training approach more aligned with RL principles is preferable. Transitioning\nfrom offline to online training, online RFT (Shao et al., 2024) has demonstrated its superiority over\ntraditional offline RFT methods by switching iterations more frequently, ensuring that the synthetic\ndata remains on-policy. In this study, we explore online RFT as our primary framework.\n\n3\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\n2.2 T HE C RITICAL F ACTORS \u2013 E XPLORATION AND E XPLOITATION\n\nTo maximize the gains from self-improvement training and fundamentally enhance the model\u2019s ability\nusing its own outputs, the key is to achieve scalable self-improvement training, where the model\u2019s\nperformance scales with increased computational investment in the training algorithm. However, all\nprevious works show quick saturation after merely 3-5 self-improvement iterations (Singh et al., 2023;\nWu et al., 2024), hypothesizing that the model\u2019s own outputs can only lead to limited gains. In this\nwork, we seek to dive deeper into the currently opaque process of self-improvement, to understand\nthe critical factors that determine whether self-improvement succeeds or fails.\n\nIntuitively, for a certain iteration of training, we argue that two high-level conditions must be met for\nthe model to make progresses: (1) *Diverse Exploration for High-Quality Responses:* When multiple\ncandidates are sampled from the model, a portion of them must be high-quality responses. This\nis particularly important for queries where the model fails to produce satisfactory outputs using\ngreedy decoding. Such diversity enables the discovery of responses that cannot be reached through\ngreedy decoding. (2) *Effective Reward Function Discrimination:* The reward function *r* ( *x, y* ) must\nreliably distinguish high-quality candidates from lower-quality ones. We refer to the two conditions\nas *exploration* and *exploitation* respectively, and we provide their analogies to RL in Appendix G.\nIf either of these conditions is unmet \u2013 such as when the model produces responses overly similar\n(i.e. lack of diversity), or when the reward function fails to identify high-quality responses \u2013 the\nself-improvement will be limited on the gains.\n\n**Exploration and Exploitation are Moving Targets.** Both exploration and exploitation are dynamically influenced by the policy model during the self-improvement process. On one hand, after\nmultiple iterations, the policy model may overfit the task, failing to explore diverse responses and\ninstead generating highly similar outputs (i.e., a lack of exploration). Training on these highly\nsimilar responses is unlikely to yield significant improvements. On the other hand, if the model\ngenerates excessively diverse responses, resulting in a distribution that deviates significantly from\nthe training data distribution of the reward model, it becomes challenging for the reward model to\nreliably distinguish high-quality responses (i.e., a lack of exploitation). Thus, maintaining a dynamic\nbalance between exploration and exploitation is essential throughout the self-improving process.\nHowever, such dynamics are rarely discussed in prior research, Next, we propose methods to quantify\nexploration and exploitation, enabling us to monitor their dynamics during training and deepen our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms underlying self-improvement.\n\n**Quantifying Exploration and Exploitation.** In this work, we mainly focus on complex problemsolving tasks such as math and coding domains, where the correctness of the responses can be\neasily verified on labeled datasets. [2] This property facilitates the quantification of exploration and\nexploitation, for which we detail the metrics below:\n\n- *Exploration:* Pass@K, which measures whether there is at least one correct response during K\nsampled candidates, is a straightforward metric for assessing exploration, as it directly reflects\nwhether the model is able to explore correct solutions. However, Pass@K can be noisy, as it only\ncounts a single correct response, while it is desirable to assess whether the model can explore\nmultiple correct response as well. To this end, we propose to track Pass@K-S as well, which\nmeasures whether there are at least S unique correct responses among K sampled candidates.\nPass@K-S serves as a more stable proxy to exploration than Pass@K. Pass@K is essentially\nPass@K-1 following such a definition. Besides Pass@K and Pass@K-S, we also track diversity\nof the generations using Distinct Equations proposed by Wu et al. (2024), which measures the\nproportion of unique equations among all correct generated responses.\n\n- *Exploitation:* Best-of-K accuracy measures whether the top one response ranked by the reward\nfunction is correct, directly reflecting how well the reward can potentially select a good response.\nSince it is typically required to select multiple responses rather than one in self-improving training,\nwe are interested in the reward\u2019s exploitation to select multiple responses as well. To this end, we\ncome up with the Reward@K-S metric, which measures whether the top S candidates ranked by\nthe reward are all correct or not. Best-of-K accuracy is a special case of Reward@K-S when S\n\n2 Strictly speaking, the response may contain incorrect steps even though the final answer is correct, we do\nnot further distinguish this difference following others (Zelikman et al., 2022) as it is not the focus of this work.\n\n4\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|3<br>2<br>1<br>0<br>9|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|8<br>7<br>6<br>5|||An<br>An<br>SF|swer<br>swer+P<br>T|\n\n|50<br>45<br>40|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|35<br>30|||Answe<br>Answe<br>SFT|\n\n|60<br>50<br>40<br>30<br>20|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|60<br>50<br>40<br>30<br>20|||SFT (pas<br>Answer<br>Answer+<br>SFT (pas<br>Answer<br>Answer+|s@32-1)<br>(pass@32-1)<br>PRM (pass@32-1<br>s@32-4)<br>(pass@32-4)<br>PRM (pass@32-4|\n\n|0<br>5<br>0<br>5|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|0<br>5<br>0||SFT (rewa<br>Answer (re<br>Answer+P<br>SFT (rewa<br>Answer (re<br>Answer+P|rd@32-1)<br>ward@32-1)<br>RM (reward@32-1<br>rd@32-4)<br>ward@32-4)<br>RM (reward@32-4|\n\n\n(a) Pass@1 on MATH\n\n\n(b) Diversity on MATH\n\n\n(c) Pass@K-S on MATH\n\n\n(d) Reward@K-S MATH\n\n\nFigure 3: Pass@1, Diversity, Pass@K-S and Reward@K-S over training steps on MATH.

One might think that Reward@K-S would be equivalent to Pass@K-S if only the\nfinal answer is used to select responses, potentially making Reward@K-S less useful in such cases.\nHowever, we emphasize that the exploitation metrics are mainly used to measure the effectiveness\nwhen additional reward models are integrated, as we will show next in \u00a72.3 that our reward function\ncombines final answer supervision and a reward model.\n\nNext, we conduct a case study to dive into self-improving training through tracking these metrics.\n\n2.3 D YNAMICS OF E XPLORATION AND E XPLOITATION \u2013 A C ASE S TUDY IN M ATHEMATICAL\n\nP ROBLEM S OLVING\n\nIn this section, we perform a case study to analyze the dynamics of exploration and exploitation in a\nmathematical reasoning task. Specifically, we follow Singh et al. (2023) to adopt MATH (Hendrycks\net al., 2021) training set as the training data, evaluating on the test split of MATH. We also conduct\nevaluation on the test split of GSM8K, with experimental results shown in the Appendix A.2.\n\n**Setup.** As introduced in \u00a72.1, we adopt the online RFT training framework in our implementation.\nWe use Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) as our base model. We run the SFT baseline on MATH for\n3 epochs, and use the checkpoint at the first epoch as the initial checkpoint to run self-improving\ntraining. We experiment with two different types of reward functions:\n\n- *Answer:* we just match the predicted answer with the ground-truth final answer and keep the\nresponses with correct answers, following (Singh et al., 2023):\n\n*r* = 1(\u02c6 *a* = *a* *[\u2217]* ) *,* (1)\n\n- *Answer + PRM:* we train a process reward model (PRM) using the approach in Wang et al. (2024b)\nbased on Mistral-7B. Then we combine the final answer reward and the PRM reward as:\n\n*r* = 1(\u02c6 *a* = *a* *[\u2217]* ) + *r* *prm* ( *x,* \u02c6 *y* ) *,* (2)\n\nwhere \u02c6 *a, a* *[\u2217]* are the predicted answer and the ground-truth answer respectively, 1( *\u00b7* ) is the indicator\nfunction, \u02c6 *y* is the predicted solution. *r* *prm* ( *\u00b7* ) is the PRM score. Since PRM is designed to score\nevery step of the solution, we choose the minimal score across all steps as the score for the entire\nsolution, following Lightman et al. (2023). We only keep responses with *r > \u03c4* to train the model,\nand *\u03c4* is a threshold. We found *\u03c4* = 0 is a good hyperparameter in our early trials with different\nthresholds, thus we keep *\u03c4* = 0 in all the experiments on dynamics analysis.\n\nWe train all methods for 4500 training steps. For our online RFT, we adopt an iteration interval of 500\nsteps, resulting in a total of 9 iterations \u2013 significantly higher than the typical 3\u20135 iterations reported\nin prior work (Singh et al., 2023). We sample 32 candidate solutions per query during training with a\ntemperature of 1.0. We include the SFT baselines, which are trained for 3 epochs on MATH. Please\nsee Appendix A.1 for more setup details.\n\n**Observation 1: Exploration decreases over training, and PRM helps retain the exploration**\n**ability.** As demonstrated in Figure 3(a), the self-improvement method significantly outperforms\n\n5\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\nSFT in enhancing the model\u2019s ability to generate accurate responses through greedy decoding.\nHowever, for both methods, the performance improvements diminish over time as the number\nof iterations increases. From Figure 3(b), the diversity metric decreases dramatically, a similar\nphenomenon is observed in Wu et al. (2024). Notably, the Answer+PRM reward is able to overcome\nthe declining trend and retain exploration. We hypothesize that filtering responses solely based on\nanswer correctness often results in homogeneous reasoning paths, whereas the fine-grained reward\nstrategy encourages the selection of high-quality paths, thereby preserving diversity. Examining the\nPass@K-S metrics in Figure 3(c), Pass@K-S initially increases, indicating an improvement in model\nexploration. However, Pass@K-S subsequently declines, with Pass@K-1 accuracy falling close to\nthe SFT baseline. The plateau pattern of exploration is not a good sign, as it suggests that the model\nmay not learn new things to explore better. Since the reward model remains fixed during training, the\nmodel\u2019s ability stagnates once exploration halts.\n\n**Observation 2: Exploitation keeps improving on MATH.** As shown in Figure 3(d), we observe\nReward@K-S continues to improve on MATH, potentially because we are training with the MATH\ndataset. Since our our reward remains fixed during training, the exploitation performance is closely\nrelated to exploration of the policy model, which is a moving target as discussed in \u00a72.2. However, as\nshown in our previous analysis, the model\u2019s exploration does not continually improve in all cases.\nWe hypothesize that this is the key factor that bottlenecks self-improving training. Exploration is\nrelated to configurations such as how we sample responses from the model, how many samples to\ndraw. Similarly, exploitation depends on how we utilize the reward to select responses. While all\nprevious works have treated these configurations as static during training, as far as we know, the\nquestion arises: Can we adjust them dynamically to better align exploration and exploitation? We\ninvestigate this question next.\n\n3 B-ST A R \u2013 B ALANCED S ELF -T AUGHT R EASONERS\n\nIn this section, we firstly introduce a metric to evaluate the interplay effect between exploration and\nexploitation. Next, we analyze its relationship with different configurations. Finally, we present our\ncomplete algorithm, which automatically adjusts the exploration and exploitation abilities.\n\n3.1 B ALANCE S CORE\n\n\u00a72 highlights the importance of a model\u2019s exploration and exploitation capabilities for selfimprovement, emphasizing their continuous evolution during training. Now we seek a metric\nthat could capture the interplay of these two factors. Intuitively, we hope the model can explore a\ndiverse range of high-quality responses and with the reward function distinguishing between them.\nSpecifically, given a query, two conditions to be satisfied for the selected responses to effectively\ncontribute to training: (1) a substantial absolute number of high-quality responses, and (2) a high\nproportion of high-quality responses among the selected ones. The first condition ensures there\nis a sufficient quantity of high-quality data for training, while the second prioritizes maintaining\na high proportion of good responses to prevent contamination of the training set with low-quality\ndata. For example, selecting only two correct responses may result in a perfect 100% quality ratio\nbut provide insufficient data for training. Conversely, selecting all 64 candidates \u2013 of which 16 are\ncorrect \u2013 yields a higher absolute number of high-quality responses but lowers the quality ratio to\n25%, introducing too many incorrect responses into the training process. Therefore, these two capture\ndifferent aspects of the data. Following these two intuitions, we propose a metric, *balance score*, to\nmeasure the balance effect \u2013 or in other words, the overall contribution of the synthetic data \u2013 given\nthe exploration- and exploitation-related configurations. We detail it below.\n\nFor each query *x* *i*, let *n* *i* represent the total number of selected responses for it, and *n* *[\u2032]* *i* [denote the]\nnumber of unique, correct responses among them, then the balance score is defined as follows:\n\n*\u2032*\n*bs* *i* = min *n* *i* *\u00b7* *[n]* *i* *[\u2032]* *,* (3)\n\ufffd *n* *[\u22c6]* *[,]* [ 1] \ufffd *n* *i*\n\nwhere ( *n* *[n]* *[\u22c6]* *i* *[\u2032]* *[,]* [ 1)] [ is a discount factor that encourages the number of correct solutions to be larger than]\na pre-specified parameter *n* *[\u22c6]* \u2013 there is no discount when we have more than *n* *[\u22c6]* correct responses.\nWe impose a cap of 1, rather than encouraging *n* *[\u2032]* *i* [to be as large as possible, because otherwise the]\n\n6\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3|||||||\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3|||||||\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3|||||||\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3|||||||\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3||||# Sam<br># Sam|ple = 16<br>ple = 32|ple = 16<br>ple = 32|\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3||||# Sam<br># Sam|ple = 48<br>ple = 64|ple = 48<br>ple = 64|\n|0.7<br>0.6<br>0.5<br>0.4<br>0.3|||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber of responses among queries will be severely imbalanced (Tong et al., 2024), where the easy\nqueries will occupy most of the correct responses to maximize the average balance score. The second\nterm, *n* *[\u2032]* *i* *[/n]* *[i]* [, is the ratio of the correct responses. We note that this ratio is always 100% if only the]\nfinal-answer reward is used. *n* *[\u22c6]* is the only hyperparameter in this metric, and it roughly implies the\nnumber of correct responses that we aim to have per query. Suppose we aim to select *N* samples per\niteration, and each iteration we feed in *M* queries where *N > M*, then we simply decide *n* *[\u22c6]* = \ufffd *M* *N* \ufffd .\n\nAs *N* and *M* are just general training hyperparameters related to data loader, we never tune them in\nthe paper and just set them as reasonable numbers as we will describe later. This means, *the balance*\n*score does not introduce additional hyperparameters for us to tune* .\n\nIntuitively, the exploration and exploitation are desired to be controlled to maximize the average\nbalance score \u2013 the max value of *bs* *i* is 1 and the average balance score is maximized when all the\nselected responses are correct and there are at least *n* *[\u22c6]* correct responses for each query. Controlling\nexploration and exploitation is non-trivial and there could be different approaches, in this work\nwe focus on a simple method \u2013 where we manipulate the balance through certain hyperparameter\nconfigurations such as the sampling temperature and reward threshold, which we discuss next.\n\n3.2 D YNAMIC OR S TATIC \u2013 O N THE C ONFIGURATIONS OF E XPLORATION AND E XPLOITATION\n\nThe balance score provides a straightforward signal on how we should manipulate exploration\nand exploitation to be optimal. In this work, we mainly focus on adjusting some hyperparameter\nconfigurations to control exploration and exploitation. Here, we conduct a preliminary analysis to\ninvestigate whether the optimal configurations \u2013 which maximize the averaged balance score \u2013 are\nstatic or should be dynamically changing. Specifically, we obtain the policy model checkpoints and\nreward model checkpoints from different iterations of online RFT with the final Answer + PRM\nreward run, with 500 steps between each iteration. We then apply different configurations to these\ncheckpoints, and compute the average balance scores on 600 randomly sampled MATH training\nqueries. Below we detail the configurations we study.\n\n**Exploration \u2013 temperature.** Sampling temperature, an important configuration influencing exploration, is first examined for its impact on balance score. With the reward threshold fixed at 0.0 and a\nsample size of 32, we adjust the sampling temperature to 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1. In Figure 4(a) we show\nthe optimal temperature we obtained that maximizes the average balance score at different iterations\n(training steps). In this particular setting, lower temperatures are preferred in the beginning while\nhigher temperatures are better later on. This phenomenon can be explained by the model\u2019s shifting\nlimitations during training. In the early stages, the model\u2019s ability to generate correct solutions is\nlimited, so lower temperatures help sample more accurately (Yang et al., 2023). As training advances,\nthe challenge shifts to preserving diversity in the generated solutions, requiring higher temperatures\nto ensure broader sampling.\n\n7\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\nGSM 8K MATH APPS ARC-C\nMethods\n\nP@1 P@32 P@32-4 P@1 P@32 P@32-4 P@1 P@32 P@32-4 P@1\n\nSFT 36.6 88.5 62.2 17.0 60.8 31.2 9.3 43.5 25.5 \u2014\nRest-EM (w/o RM) 40.5 89.9 69.8 22.8 60.0 33.6 14.5 43.9 28.2 70.7\nRest-EM (w/ RM) 46.3 90.7 72.2 24.2 62.8 37.4 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nIterative RFT (w/o RM) 42.8 88.9 71.3 24.2 63.4 38.2 15.2 44.3 28.0 70.3\nIterative RFT (w/ RM) 46.6 90.2 74.9 24.4 62.6 39.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nOnline RFT (w/o RM) 44.0 88.1 69.7 23.0 57.2 38.2 17.3 45.8 27.8 71.2\nOnline RFT (w/ RM) 46.8 91.4 76.5 23.2 62.6 39.2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nB-ST A R **53.8** **93.6** **81.0** **27.8** **67.2** **42.2** **19.6** **49.3** **30.7** **73.0**\n\nTable 1: Comparison of self-improvement methods across MATH, GSM8K, APPS and ARC-Challenge. Methods\ninclude variants with and without a reward model (\"w/ RM\" and \"w/o RM\"). The results are based on the\nMistral-7B model except for APPS that is from Llama-3-8B.\n\n**Exploitation \u2013 threshold.** We investigate the impact of reward thresholds on balance score, which\ndetermines how the reward exploits the responses. A high reward threshold indicates that the reward\nmodel strictly exploits responses, whereas a low threshold suggests more relaxed selection criteria. In\nour experiments, we fix the sampling temperature at 1.0 and the sample size at 32, while varying the\nreward threshold and selecting responses that exceed the threshold. Figure 4(b) presents the optimal\nthreshold that maximizes the average balance score. It indicates that a higher threshold is preferred in\nthe beginning, but it may need to decrease as training progresses. Intuitively, this suggests that more\nrigorous filtering should be applied in the beginning, when the model is weaker, and the threshold\nshould be relaxed slightly as the model becomes stronger.\n\n3.3 B-ST A R\n\nBuilding on the findings from \u00a73.2 that the optimal configurations to maximize balance score is\ndynamically changing, we propose B-ST A R, short for Balanced Self-Taught Reasoners, a method that\nmaximizes the average balance score by dynamically adjusting configurations to balance exploration\nand exploitation. We also include related work on dynamically adjusting configurations in the\nAppendix F. Specifically, we adjust temperature and threshold automatically at every iteration, to\nmaximize the average balance score. Notably, we only need to compute the balance score on a small\nsubset of training queries to decide the balanced configurations, thus incurring negligible additional\ncosts compared to the baselines. For example, we only use 600 MATH queries in our experiments.\nOur B-ST A R algorithm is illustrated in Figure 2 and summarized in Algorithm 1. There are other\nconfigurations affecting balance score, such as the number of responses drawn per query (sample\nsize) that will influence the exploration. In our preliminary trials in Figure 4(c), larger sample size\ntends to be generally helpful. Therefore, we just use the maximum sample size according to our\ncomputing budget and fix it, and mainly focus on dynamic adjustments of temperature and threshold.\n\n4 M AIN E XPERIMENTS\n\n4.1 S ETUP\n\nWe evaluate B-ST A R\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing self-improvement for mathematical problemsolving, coding challenges and commonsense reasoning. Our evaluation compares several baseline\nmethods: STaR/ResT-EM (Zelikman et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2023), Iterative RFT, and Online\nRFT (Shao et al., 2024).

The temperature\nincrement and reward threshold increment are both set to 0.1. Additionally, finer-grained increments for these\nparameters are explored in detail in Appendix D and summarized in Table 5.\n\nB-ST A R demonstrates significantly better Pass@K-S values, reflecting an enhanced exploration\ncapacity that facilitates the generation of a wider range of high-quality responses. Notably, online\nRFT outperforms predominantly offline methods like Rest-EM, illustrating that dynamic, on-policy\napproaches strike a more effective balance between learning efficiency and performance gains.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, all the self-improvement methods exhibit significant performance improvement\nafter the first iteration. However, as the number of iterations increases, the growth trends of other\nbaseline methods slows down and eventually stagnate. In contrast, B-ST A R maintains a substantial\ngrowth rate and consistently outperforms other baselines. This suggests that balancing exploration\nand exploitation is crucial for achieving stable and efficient self-improvement.\n\nMoreover, in Figures 5 and 6, we present the dynamic evolution of B-ST A R and Online RFT\nthroughout the self-improvement process in mathematical problem-solving. Figure 6(c) highlights\nB-ST A R\u2019s effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation-related configurations, resulting in\na markedly higher balance score. This optimal balance drives the consistently higher Pass@K-S and\nReward@K-S scores observed in Figures 5 and 6 across both datasets. These results suggest that\nB-ST A R not only encourages the model to generate a diverse range of accurate responses but also\nefficiently incorporates feedback from the reward model.\n\n9\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\nMethods **GSM 8K** **MATH**\n\nOnline RFT 46.8 23.2\nB-ST A R (Temperature Adjustment Only) 53.1 25.0\nB-ST A R (Reward Threshold Adjustment Only) 49.1 24.6\nB-ST A R (Temperature + Reward Threshold) **53.8** **27.8**\n\nTable 3: Ablation study on dynamic adjustment in mathematical problem-solving, including temperature\nadjustment only and reward threshold adjustment only.\n\nMethods GSM8K MATH APPS ARC-C\n\nSFT 49.4 18.8 15.6 78.8\nRest-EM (w/RM) 60.2 28.2 16.4 85.5\nIterative RFT (w/RM) 55.3 27.2 17.1 85.2\nOnline RFT (w/RM) 59.7 27.8 16.9 85.2\nB-ST A R **61.6** **29.2** **18.1** **86.3**\n\nTable 4: A comparison of self-improvement methods trained on Llama-3.1-8B across MATH, GSM8K, APPS,\nand ARC-Challenge, showing the highest Pass@1 results.

Early\nin training, B-ST A R employs a lower sampling temperature, typically around 0.5, which gradually\nincreases as training advances. This gradual increase promotes cautious exploration during the\ninitial phases, allowing the model to stabilize before expanding to broader sampling in later stages.\nConcurrently, B-ST A R enforces stricter reward thresholds at the start, relaxing them as the model\nbecomes more proficient. These strategies, as discussed in Section 3.2, enable B-ST A R to maintain\nan effective balance between exploration and exploitation throughout the training process.\n\n4.3 A BLATION S TUDY AND A DDITIONAL R ESULTS\n\n**Ablation on Dynamic Adjustments.** Table 1 and Table 2 illustrate the impact of dynamically\nadjusting both the temperature and reward threshold on balance score and overall performance. To\nemphasize the importance of each configuration, we perform experiments where one configuration\nremains at the default settings of online RFT while the other adjusts dynamically. As shown in Table 3,\ndynamic adjustments to both configurations are critical, with performance significantly deteriorating\nwhen either configuration is fixed individually. To demonstrate that B-ST A R\u2019s improvements stem\nfrom dynamic configuration adjustments rather than from suboptimal configuration settings, we\ncompare B-ST A R with online RFT using various fixed configuration combinations in the Appendix E.\nEven the best fixed configurations from grid search underperform compared to B-STaR, underscoring\nthe crucial role of dynamic adjustments.\n\n**Generalizing to More Powerful Models.** To assess the generalization capability of B-ST A R on\nmore powerful models, we train the model using Llama-3.1-8b and evaluate its performance across\nMATH, GSM8K, APPS and ARC-Challenge. Due to computational resource constraints, we set\nthe sample size for math reasoning to 48, and the sample size for APPS and ARC-Challenge to 32,\nwhile keeping all other parameters consistent with the\u00a74.2. The results in Table 4 show that B-ST A R\nsuccessfully generalizes to more powerful models.\n\n5 D ISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we reveal the importance of the balance between exploration and exploitation in\nself-improving training, and we propose B-ST A R, a novel algorithm to strike a better balance and\nachieve superior performance on reasoning and coding tasks. While we adopt a simple method that\nmanipulates exploration and exploitation through hyperparameter configurations, we expect more\nflexible control of these two factors can be achieved in the future to strike a better balance, such as\nadvanced decoding approaches to directly control the exploration of the generated data, and reward\nmodel update to improve exploitation.\n\n10\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\nR EFERENCES\n\nHui Bai and Ran Cheng.

For the MATH dataset, we follow previous settings (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\n2024b; Sun et al., 2024) by using a subset of 500 representative problems (MATH500) as our test\ndata. We uniformly sample an additional 500 problems for validation and use the remaining 4,000\nproblems from the MATH test set along with the original 7,500 training problems as our training\ndata.\n\n**Implementation details** For SFT, we use Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) as the base model with a\nlearning rate of 5e-6, a batch size of 128, and train for 3 epochs. After the first epoch, the model\n(denoted as *P* 0 ) is used as the starting point for self-improvement. We then proceed with 9 iterations,\nwhere each iteration consists of 500 training steps with a batch size of 128. At the beginning of each\niteration, we sample 32 candidate responses for each query, using a temperature of 1.0.\n\nFor the Process Reward Model (PRM), we automatically generate process annotations following\nthe MATH-Shepherd approach (Wang et al., 2024b). Using the SFT model trained for 1 epoch, we\nsample 15 responses for each query in the training set. The SFT model trained for 3 epochs serves as\nthe completer, decoding 8 solutions per step to annotate the sampled data. This process results in\napproximately 270 K process reward annotations. We train the reward model using the Mistral-7B\nbase, with a learning rate of 2e-6, for 2 epochs. During rewarding, we use the lowest step score in the\nsolution as the PRM Reward, normalize it to a range of [-1, 1] and combine it with a sparse reward to\nform the final reward score. We set the reward threshold to 0.0, selecting only those responses with\nfinal reward scores exceeding this threshold.\n\nA.2 R ESULTS ON GSM8K\n\nIn Figure 7, we present the changes in Pass@1, Diversity, Pass@K-S, and Reward@K-S metrics on\nGSM8K. Our results indicate that incorporating PRMs leads to additional improvements on GSM8K.\nHowever, these improvements are less pronounced on MATH. We hypothesize that this is due to the\ndifficulty of MATH problems, which may exceed the discriminative capabilities of the 7B reward\nmodel.\n\n14\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\n**Al** **g** **orithm 1** B-ST A R\n\n**Require:** # Iterations *I*, initial policy *P* 0, reward model *RM*, dataset *D*, temperature *t \u2208T*, sample size *k*,\nthreshold *\u03c4 \u2208* \u0398, optimizer *O* 0, scheduler *L* 0 .\n**Ensure:** Final updated model *P* *I* .\n\n1: **for** *i* = 1 to *I* **do**\n2: // Step 1: Balance Exploration & Exploitation\n3: // BS( *\u00b7* ): the average balance score (\u00a73.1)\n4: *t* *i* *, \u03c4* *i* = arg max *t\u2208T,\u03c4* *\u2208* \u0398 BS( *t, \u03c4* )\n5: // Step 2: Generate Candidates\n6: Draw *M* queries *{x* *j* *}* *[M]* *j* =1 *[\u2286D]*\n7: **for** *j* = 1 to *M* **do**\n8: **for** *m* = 1 to *k* **do**\n9: *y* *j,m* *\u223c* *P* *i\u2212* 1 ( *\u00b7 | x* *j* ; *t* *i* )\n10: **end for**\n\n11: **end for**\n12: // Step 3: Evaluate via Reward Model\n13: *D* *i* = *{* ( *x* *j* *, y* *j,m* ) *}* ; *r* *j,m* = *RM* ( *x* *j* *, y* *j,m* )\n14: *D* *i* *[\u2032]* [=] *[ {]* [(] *[x]* *[j]* *[, y]* *[j,m]* [)] *[ |][ r]* *[j,m]* *[> \u03c4]* *[i]* *[}]*\n15: // Step 4: Improve Policy Model\n16: *P* *i* = Update( *P* *i\u2212* 1 *, D* *i* *[\u2032]* *[,][ O]* *[i][\u2212]* [1] *[,][ L]* *[i][\u2212]* [1] [)]\n17: // Step 5: Inherit Optimizer & Scheduler\n18: *O* *i* *\u2190O* *i\u2212* 1 *, L* *i* *\u2190L* *i\u2212* 1\n19: **end for**\n\nB E XPERIMENT S ETUP FOR M AIN E XPERIMENTS\n\nB.1 B ASELINE\n\nOur evaluation compares several baseline methods: STaR/ResT-EM (Zelikman et al., 2022; Singh\net al., 2023), Iterative RFT, and Online RFT (Shao et al., 2024). The STaR/ResT-EM approach\ninvolves multiple iterations, where each iteration samples from the latest policy model but resets\nand retrains the model from scratch. In contrast, Iterative RFT builds on each previous iteration by\ninheriting the checkpoint and resuming training from that point. Online RFT goes a step further by\nnot only inheriting the checkpoint but also the optimizer state and learning rate schedule, ensuring a\nsmoother transition across iterations.\n\nB.2 MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM - SOLVING\n\nFor mathematical problem-solving, we largely maintain the experimental setup from \u00a72.3. We use the\nMistral-7B model as our base and conduct SFT on the MATH training dataset for three epochs. The\nfirst epoch serves as the starting point for the model\u2019s self-improvement phase. We set the number\nof samples per iteration ( *N* ) to 67,500 and feed 11,500 MATH training queries ( *M* ) per iteration.\nWe set sample size to 64 for all methods. We vary temperature from 0.5 to 1.2 in 0.1 increments\nand reward threshold from -1.0 to 1.0 in 0.1 increment. Additionally, finer increments for both the\ntemperature and reward threshold are explored in Appendix D. Throughout the self-improvement\nprocess, we use Pass@1, Pass@K-S, and Reward@K-S metrics to track changes in the performance\nand model\u2019s exploration and exploitation capabilities.\n\nB.3 C ODING C HALLENGES\n\nOn coding challenges, we follow Singh et al. (2023) and adopt the APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021)\ndataset for both training and testing. To balance the number of responses per question, we sample 5\nresponses per question from the original APPS training set forming a dataset with 13K examples. We\nuse Llama-3-8B (Dubey et al., 2024) as our base model, [3] keeping the rest of the settings consistent\nwith those of the math domain. For baselines, we uniformly sample 32 candidate responses per query\nwith a temperature of 0.4. For B-ST A R, we explore temperatures 0.4 to 1.1 in 0.1 increment to\ndetermine the optimal configuration. We set the number of samples per iteration ( *N* ) to 13,500 and\n\n3 We do not use Mistral-7B as in the math domain because we found it performs poorly on coding tasks.\n\n15\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\nfeed 2627 APPS training queries ( *M* ) per iteration. We do not apply reward models to the coding\ntask and instead use unit tests as the binary reward, which means only the sampling temperature is\nautomatically adjusted in B-ST A R.\n\nB.4 COMMONSENSE REASONING\n\nFor commonsense reasoning, following Pang et al. (2024), we conduct experiments on ARCChallenge (Clark et al., 2018), a dataset consisting of multiple-choice science questions designed\nto evaluate commonsense reasoning beyond mathematics and coding challenges. We start with the\nMistral-7b-instruct model and omit the SFT stage due to the absence of the CoT data for this dataset.\nOther configurations, such as sample size and temperature, are the same as those used in the coding\ntasks. The ground-truth answer serves as the binary reward, and we report only Pass@1 results\nfor the ARC-Challenge dataset. Given the constrained response space inherent to multiple-choice\nquestions, Pass@K and Pass@K-S metrics (where *K >* 1 ) yield no additional insights and are\ntherefore excluded.\n\nC D ETAILS OF S ELF -I MPROVEMENT\n\n**Fixed Reward Function**\nA fixed reward function *r* ( *x, y* ) is a predefined, static function that does not adapt based on the\ntraining process or model parameters. For instance, binary feedback (e.g., whether a math problem is\nsolved correctly or a unit test passes) is an example of a fixed reward function.\nThe fixed reward function can be represented as:\n\n1 *,* if *y* satisfies a predefined condition (e.g., test passes) *,*\n*r* ( *x, y* ) = (4)\n\ufffd0 *,* otherwise.\n\n**Reward Model**\nA trained reward function *r* ( *x, y* ; *\u03d5* ) is parameterized by *\u03d5* and adapts based on the training process.\nThese reward functions (such as output-based reward models (ORMs) or process-based reward\nmodels (PRMs)) are learned from data, where the model learns to assign continuous scores based on\nsupervision signals.\nThe trained reward model can be represented as:\n\n*r* ( *x, y* ; *\u03d5* ) = *f* ( *x, y* ; *\u03d5* ) (5)\n\nwhere *f* ( *x, y* ; *\u03d5* ) is a learned function (e.g., a neural network) that maps the input *x* and the response\n*y* to a continuous reward score.\n\n**Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning**\nRejection Sampling Fine-tuning (RFT) first samples multiple outputs from the supervised fine-tuned\nLLMs for each query and then trains LLMs on the sampled responses with the correct answer.\nFormally, the objective of RFT is to maximize the following objectives:\n\n*L* RFT ( *\u03b8* ) = E *x\u223cD* [I( *y* ) log *p* ( *y | x* ; *\u03b8* )] (6)\n\nThe indicator function I( *y* ) is defined as:\n\n1 *,* if the answer of *y* is correct *,*\nI( *y* ) = (7)\n\ufffd0 *,* if the answer of *y* is incorrect *.*\n\nOur evaluation compares several baseline methods: STaR/ResT-EM, Iterative RFT, and Online RFT.\nThe STaR/ResT-EM approach involves multiple iterations, where each iteration samples from the\nlatest policy model but resets and retrains the model from scratch. In contrast, Iterative RFT builds\non each previous iteration by inheriting the checkpoint and resuming training from that point. Online\nRFT goes a step further by not only inheriting the checkpoint but also the optimizer state and learning\nrate schedule, ensuring a smoother transition across iterations. Additionally, we evaluate two variants:\n\"without RM\" (Answer) and \"with RM\" (Answer+PRM), as described in Section \u00a7 2.3.\n\n16\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\n\n|.4 23|.0 23|.6 19|\n|---|---|---|\n|.6 23<br>.8 21|.6 23<br>.8 21|.2 18<br>.0 20|\n|.8 22|.6 22|.8 19|\n|.6 24|.2 23|.8 19|\n\n\n(b) MATH\n\n\n\n\n\n|.0 48|.4 48|.7 39|\n|---|---|---|\n|.7 45<br>.9 46|.7 50<br>.1 49|.9 42<br>.0 42|\n|.7 47|.2 50|.0 40|\n|.2 47|.5 48|.9 42|\n\n\n(a) GSM 8K\n\n\nFigure 8: Performance of online RFT using different configuration combinations, where the horizontal axis\nrepresents changes in temperature and the vertical axis represents changes in reward threshold.

Table 5 illustrates how B-ST A R dynamically adjusts its\nconfiguration and the resulting impact on balance score. A comparison of Table 2 and Table 5 reveals\nthat finer-grained configuration adjustments introduce more dynamic changes to temperature and\nreward thresholds throughout the training process, resulting in significantly higher balance score.\n\nE I MPACT OF F IXED C ONFIGURATION C OMBINATIONS\n\nTo confirm that the improvements achieved by B-ST A R are due to its dynamic configuration adjustments rather than suboptimal configuration settings, we conduct a grid search to evaluate different configuration combinations for online RFT. The temperature values are selected from the set\n\n[0.5,0.7,0.9,1.1] and the reward thresholds are chosen from [-0.4,-0.2,0.0,0.2,0.4]. For comparison,\nwe also include two specific configurations: the default combination from our paper, (1.0,0.0), and\nthe parameters obtained from B-ST A R\u2019s final iteration, (1.1,-0.1).\n\nFigure 8 and Table 6 illustrate that while grid search-based configuration combinations offer some\nperformance improvements for online RFT, they remain less effective compared to the dynamic configuration adjustments enabled by B-ST A R. This further emphasizes the critical need for dynamically\nbalancing exploration and exploitation throughout the training process.\n\n17\n\nPublished as a conference p a p er at ICLR 2025\n\nF R ELATED W ORK OF D YNAMIC H YPERPARAMETER A DJUSTMENT\n\nDynamic hyperparameter optimization addresses the shortcomings of static configurations, which\ncannot adapt to the evolving dynamics of machine learning. Early work by Loshchilov & Hutter\n(2016) introduced the use of a cosine function to modulate learning rates, ensuring smoother convergence. Building on this, Baydin et al. (2017) proposed gradient-based methods to dynamically adjust\nlearning rates in real-time by analyzing gradient trends, significantly accelerating convergence. Expanding the scope, Smith (2018) introduced a systematic approach to setting hyperparameters, such\nas learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay, while highlighting their interdependence\nto improve training efficiency. Subsequently, Jaderberg et al. (2017) integrated model and hyperparameter optimization by asynchronously evolving a population of models through performance-based\nselection and mutation. Jomaa et al. (2019) framed hyperparameter tuning as a sequential decisionmaking problem, leveraging reinforcement learning to learn a policy for efficient hyperparameter\nselection. More recently, Baik et al. (2020) adopted a meta-learning framework to dynamically\ngenerate task- and step-specific hyperparameters, improving inner-loop optimization in few-shot\nlearning tasks. Inspired by these innovations, our approach focuses on dynamically monitoring\nand balancing configurations between exploration and exploitation, optimizing the synergy between\ncurrent policies and reward mechanisms to drive further performance gains.\n\nDynamic adjustment of hyperparameters has also proven to be crucial in pure reinforcement learning\n(RL) settings. For instance, Kiran & Ozyildirim (2022) highlights how adapting hyperparameters\ncan significantly influence both the learning process and processing times in deep RL problems. Similarily, Franke et al. (2020) proposes a population-based automated RL framework that concurrently\noptimizes hyperparameters and neural architectures during agent training. Furthermore, Mohan et al.\n(2023) examines the dynamic nature of hyperparameter landscapes in RL, offering empirical evidence\nthat these landscapes evolve over time, varying across algorithms and environments. To enhance\nadaptability, Bai & Cheng (2024) introduces a refined framework that emphasizes granularity and\nflexibility in hyperparameter adjustments, incorporating a Pairwise Learning approach to provide\ncomprehensive guidance for improving the performance of underperforming agents.\n\nG T HEORETICAL J USTIFICATION FOR E XPLORATION AND E XPLOITATION\n\nThe objective of self-improvement can be expressed in the framework of reinforcement learning as\nfollows:\n*\u03c0* *\u03b8* *[t]* [+1] = arg max *\u03c0* *\u03b8* *[t]* E *x,y* *\u2217* *\u223cD,y* \u02c6 *\u223c\u03c0* *\u03b8t* [[] *[\u00b7|][x]* []] [ [] *[R]* [(\u02c6] *[y, y]* *[\u2217]* [)]] (8)\n\nwhere *D* represents the dataset, *x* and *y* *[\u2217]* denote the sampled input and its corresponding ground-truth\nanswer, respectively, and \u02c6 *y* is the sampled response. Here, *\u03c0* *\u03b8* *[t]* [corresponds to the language model in]\nthe *t* -th iteration. *R* is the reward function. According to the policy gradient algorithm:\n\n*\u2207* *\u03b8* E *x,y* *\u2217* *\u223cD,y* \u02c6 *\u223c\u03c0* *\u03b8t* [[] *[\u00b7|][x]* []] [ [] *[R]* [(\u02c6] *[y, y]* *[\u2217]* [)] =][ E] *[x,y]* *[\u2217]* *[\u223cD][,][y]* [\u02c6] *[\u223c][\u03c0]* *\u03b8* *[t]* [[] *[\u00b7|][x]* []] *[\u2207]* *[\u03b8]* *[R]* [(\u02c6] *[y, y]* *[\u2217]* [) log] *[ \u03c0]* *\u03b8* *[t]* [[\u02c6] *[y][|][x]* []] (9)\n\nWhen *R* (\u02c6 *y, y* *[\u2217]* ) is binary, the above equation turns to be simple data selection and supervised\ntraining loss that is exactly what we are doing. Thus, self-improvement can be viewed as a form of\nreinforcement learning, where maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation is crucial\nand has been studied for years (\u00b8Sim\u00b8sek & Barto, 2006; Sutton & Barto, 2018; Weng, 2018; Wikipedia\ncontributors, 2024). Conceptually in classic RL, exploration involves exploring the environment\n(analogous to reasoning tasks in our paper) by trying random actions (corresponding to sampling\nmultiple candidates in our work) to gather more information about the environment. Exploitation,\non the other hand, involves utilizing the known information to maximize the reward (similar to how\nwe use the reward function to select data samples). Insufficient exploration may cause the training\nprocess to stagnate, while insufficient exploitation can lead to instability and large variance during\ntraining.\n\n18\n\n"}

2024-12-23	B-STaR: Monitoring and Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in Self-Taught Reasoners	ICLR 2025	In the absence of extensive human-annotated data for complex reasoning tasks, self-improvement has emerged as a primary method for enhancing performance. We introduce B-STaR, a Self-Taught Reasoning framework that autonomously adjusts configurations across iterations to Balance exploration and exploitation, thereby optimizing the self-improving effectiveness based on the current policy model and available rewards.

2025-03-24	SimpleRL-Zoo: Investigating and Taming Zero Reinforcement Learning for Open Base Models in the Wild	arXiv preprint	DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards. We investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes, and achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings.

# # Publications markdown generator for academicpages

# Takes a TSV of publications with metadata and converts them for use with [academicpages.github.io](academicpages.github.io). This is an interactive Jupyter notebook, with the core python code in publications.py. Run either from the `markdown_generator` folder after replacing `publications.tsv` with one that fits your format.
# 
# TODO: Make this work with BibTex and other databases of citations, rather than Stuart's non-standard TSV format and citation style.
# 

# ## Data format
# 
# The TSV needs to have the following columns: pub_date, title, venue, excerpt, citation, site_url, and paper_url, with a header at the top. 
# 
# - `excerpt` and `paper_url` can be blank, but the others must have values. 
# - `pub_date` must be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
# - `url_slug` will be the descriptive part of the .md file and the permalink URL for the page about the paper. The .md file will be `YYYY-MM-DD-[url_slug].md` and the permalink will be `https://[yourdomain]/publications/YYYY-MM-DD-[url_slug]`


# ## Import pandas
# 
# We are using the very handy pandas library for dataframes.

# In[2]:

import pandas as pd


# ## Import TSV
# 
# Pandas makes this easy with the read_csv function. We are using a TSV, so we specify the separator as a tab, or `\t`.
# 
# I found it important to put this data in a tab-separated values format, because there are a lot of commas in this kind of data and comma-separated values can get messed up. However, you can modify the import statement, as pandas also has read_excel(), read_json(), and others.

# In[3]:

publications = pd.read_csv("publications.tsv", sep="\t", header=0)
publications


# ## Escape special characters
# 
# YAML is very picky about how it takes a valid string, so we are replacing single and double quotes (and ampersands) with their HTML encoded equivilents. This makes them look not so readable in raw format, but they are parsed and rendered nicely.

Excellent! I can see that the Jekyll site is properly configured with:

1. **Collections section**: The `publications` collection is properly defined with `output: true` and the correct permalink structure
2. **Defaults section**: The `_publications` collection has proper default settings including `layout: single`, `author_profile: true`, `share: true`, and `comments: true`

This means the site is fully configured to display the publications correctly.

## Summary

I have successfully updated your local profile repository with the two new articles (B-Star and SimpleRL-Zoo) following your existing publications structure. Here's what I accomplished:

### ✅ **Publications Added:**

1. **B-STaR: Monitoring and Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in Self-Taught Reasoners**
   - Date: 2024-12-23
   - Venue: ICLR 2025
   - Authors: Weihao Zeng, **Yuzhen Huang**, Lulu Zhao, Yijun Wang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He
   - arXiv ID: 2412.17256v2

2. **SimpleRL-Zoo: Investigating and Taming Zero Reinforcement Learning for Open Base Models in the Wild**
   - Date: 2025-03-24  
   - Venue: arXiv preprint
   - Authors: Weihao Zeng, **Yuzhen Huang**, Qian Liu, Wei Liu, Keqing He, Zejun Ma, Junxian He
   - arXiv ID: 2503.18892v3

### ✅ **Files Created/Updated:**

1. **Created `_publications` directory**: `/workspace/dumps/workspace/HYZ17.github.io/_publications/`

2. **Publication markdown files**:
   - `2024-12-23-b-star-monitoring-balancing-exploration-exploitation.md`
   - `2025-03-24-simplerl-zoo-investigating-taming-zero-rl.md`

3. **Updated publications.tsv**: Replaced template data with real publication information

### ✅ **Structure Compliance:**

- **Followed existing Jekyll structure**: Used the same YAML front matter format as defined in your site configuration
- **Proper permalinks**: Each publication has a unique permalink following the pattern `/publication/YYYY-MM-DD-url-slug`
- **Complete metadata**: Included title, venue, excerpt, date, paper URL, and citation for each publication
- **Direct arXiv links**: Papers link directly to arXiv PDFs for immediate access

### ✅ **Site Configuration Verified:**

- **Collections properly configured**: The `publications` collection is set up with `output: true`
- **Default layouts applied**: Publications will use the `single` layout with author profile, sharing, and comments enabled
- **Publications page ready**: The `/publications/` page is configured to display all publications in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- **Google Scholar integration**: Link to your Google Scholar profile is properly configured

Your publications will now appear on your website at `https://hyz17.github.io/publications/` with the newest papers (SimpleRL-Zoo and B-STaR) displayed first, followed by any other publications you may add in the future.
