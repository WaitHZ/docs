Introduction\\nMachine learning is experiencing a renaissance powered\\nby transformers. Over the past \ufb01ve years, neural architec-\\ntures for natural language processing [8, 42], vision [10]\\nand several other domains have largely been subsumed by\\ntransformers [60]. Many classes of image-level genera-\\ntive models remain holdouts to the trend, though\u2014while\\ntransformers see widespread use in autoregressive mod-\\nels [3,6,43,47], they have seen less adoption in other gener-\\native modeling frameworks. For example, diffusion models\\nhave been at the forefront of recent advances in image-level\\ngenerative models [9,46]; yet, they all adopt a convolutional\\nU-Net architecture as the de-facto choice of backbone.\\n*Work done during an internship at Meta AI, FAIR Team.\\nCode and project page available here.\\n1arXiv:2212.09748v2  [cs.CV]  2 Mar 2023\\n\\n=== Page 2 ===\\n520 80 320GflopsDiameterFigure 2.

Performance steadily improves in FID as model \ufb02ops increase.\\nRight: Our best model, DiT-XL/2, is compute-ef\ufb01cient and outperforms all prior U-Net-based diffusion models, like ADM and LDM.\\nThe seminal work of Ho et al. [19] \ufb01rst introduced the\\nU-Net backbone for diffusion models. Having initially seen\\nsuccess within pixel-level autoregressive models and con-\\nditional GANs [23], the U-Net was inherited from Pixel-\\nCNN++ [52, 58] with a few changes. The model is con-\\nvolutional, comprised primarily of ResNet [15] blocks. In\\ncontrast to the standard U-Net [49], additional spatial self-\\nattention blocks, which are essential components in trans-\\nformers, are interspersed at lower resolutions. Dhariwal and\\nNichol [9] ablated several architecture choices for the U-\\nNet, such as the use of adaptive normalization layers [40] to\\ninject conditional information and channel counts for con-\\nvolutional layers. However, the high-level design of the U-\\nNet from Ho et al. has largely remained intact.\\nWith this work, we aim to demystify the signi\ufb01cance of\\narchitectural choices in diffusion models and offer empiri-\\ncal baselines for future generative modeling research. We\\nshow that the U-Net inductive bias is notcrucial to the per-\\nformance of diffusion models, and they can be readily re-\\nplaced with standard designs such as transformers. As a\\nresult, diffusion models are well-poised to bene\ufb01t from the\\nrecent trend of architecture uni\ufb01cation\u2014e.g., by inheriting\\nbest practices and training recipes from other domains, as\\nwell as retaining favorable properties like scalability, ro-\\nbustness and ef\ufb01ciency. A standardized architecture would\\nalso open up new possibilities for cross-domain research.\\nIn this paper, we focus on a new class of diffusion models\\nbased on transformers. We call them Diffusion Transform-\\ners, or DiTs for short. DiTs adhere to the best practices of\\nVision Transformers (ViTs) [10], which have been shown to\\nscale more effectively for visual recognition than traditional\\nconvolutional networks (e.g., ResNet [15]).More speci\ufb01cally, we study the scaling behavior of trans-\\nformers with respect to network complexity vs. sample\\nquality . We show that by constructing and benchmark-\\ning the DiT design space under the Latent Diffusion Mod-\\nels(LDMs) [48] framework, where diffusion models are\\ntrained within a V AE\u2019s latent space, we can successfully\\nreplace the U-Net backbone with a transformer. We further\\nshow that DiTs are scalable architectures for diffusion mod-\\nels: there is a strong correlation between the network com-\\nplexity (measured by G\ufb02ops) vs. sample quality (measured\\nby FID). By simply scaling-up DiT and training an LDM\\nwith a high-capacity backbone (118.6 G\ufb02ops), we are able\\nto achieve a state-of-the-art result of 2.27 FID on the class-\\nconditional 256\\u0002256ImageNet generation benchmark.\\n2. Related Work\\nTransformers. Transformers [60] have replaced domain-\\nspeci\ufb01c architectures across language, vision [10], rein-\\nforcement learning [5, 25] and meta-learning [39]. They\\nhave shown remarkable scaling properties under increas-\\ning model size, training compute and data in the language\\ndomain [26], as generic autoregressive models [17] and\\nas ViTs [63]. Beyond language, transformers have been\\ntrained to autoregressively predict pixels [6, 7, 38]. They\\nhave also been trained on discrete codebooks [59] as both\\nautoregressive models [11,47] and masked generative mod-\\nels [4, 14]; the former has shown excellent scaling behavior\\nup to 20B parameters [62]. Finally, transformers have been\\nexplored in DDPMs to synthesize non-spatial data; e.g., to\\ngenerate CLIP image embeddings in DALL \\u0001E 2 [41,46]. In\\nthis paper, we study the scaling properties of transformers\\nwhen used as the backbone of diffusion models of images.\\n2\\n\\n=== Page 3 ===\\nMulti-Head Self-AttentionLayer NormScale, ShiftMLPPointwise FeedforwardLayer NormScale, ShiftScale++\\nScale\ud835\udefe!,\ud835\udefd!\ud835\udefc!\ud835\udefe\\\",\ud835\udefd\\\"\ud835\udefc\\\"\\nInput TokensConditioningDiTBlock with adaLN-ZeroLatent Diffusion TransformerTimestep \ud835\udc61Label \ud835\udc66DiTBlockN xPatchifyLayer NormLinear and ReshapeEmbedNoise\u03a332 x 32 x 432 x 32 x 4\\nNoised Latent32 x 32 x 4Multi-Head Self-AttentionLayer NormPointwise Feedforward\\nLayer Norm++\\nInput TokensConditioningDiTBlock with Cross-AttentionMulti-Head Cross-AttentionLayer Norm+Multi-Head Self-AttentionLayer NormPointwise Feedforward++\\nInput TokensConditioningDiTBlock with In-Context ConditioningLayer Norm\\nConcatenate on Sequence DimensionFigure 3.

Right: Details of our DiT blocks. We experiment with variants of standard transformer\\nblocks that incorporate conditioning via adaptive layer norm, cross-attention and extra input tokens. Adaptive layer norm works best.\\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs).\\nDiffusion [19, 54] and score-based generative models [22,\\n56] have been particularly successful as generative models\\nof images [35,46,48,50], in many cases outperforming gen-\\nerative adversarial networks (GANs) [12] which had previ-\\nously been state-of-the-art. Improvements in DDPMs over\\nthe past two years have largely been driven by improved\\nsampling techniques [19, 27, 55], most notably classi\ufb01er-\\nfree guidance [21], reformulating diffusion models to pre-\\ndict noise instead of pixels [19] and using cascaded DDPM\\npipelines where low-resolution base diffusion models are\\ntrained in parallel with upsamplers [9, 20]. For all the dif-\\nfusion models listed above, convolutional U-Nets [49] are\\nthe de-facto choice of backbone architecture. Concurrent\\nwork [24] introduced a novel, ef\ufb01cient architecture based\\non attention for DDPMs; we explore pure transformers.\\nArchitecture complexity. When evaluating architecture\\ncomplexity in the image generation literature, it is fairly\\ncommon practice to use parameter counts. In general, pa-\\nrameter counts can be poor proxies for the complexity of\\nimage models since they do not account for, e.g., image res-\\nolution which signi\ufb01cantly impacts performance [44, 45].\\nInstead, much of the model complexity analysis in this pa-\\nper is through the lens of theoretical G\ufb02ops. This brings us\\nin-line with the architecture design literature where G\ufb02ops\\nare widely-used to gauge complexity. In practice, the\\ngolden complexity metric is still up for debate as it fre-\\nquently depends on particular application scenarios. Nichol\\nand Dhariwal\u2019s seminal work improving diffusion mod-\\nels [9, 36] is most related to us\u2014there, they analyzed the\\nscalability and G\ufb02op properties of the U-Net architecture\\nclass. In this paper, we focus on the transformer class.3. Diffusion Transformers\\n3.1. Preliminaries\\nDiffusion formulation. Before introducing our architec-\\nture, we brie\ufb02y review some basic concepts needed to\\nunderstand diffusion models (DDPMs) [19, 54]. Gaus-\\nsian diffusion models assume a forward noising process\\nwhich gradually applies noise to real data x0:q(xtjx0) =\\nN(xt;p\\u0016\\u000btx0;(1\\u0000\\u0016\\u000bt)I), where constants \\u0016\\u000btare hyperpa-\\nrameters. By applying the reparameterization trick, we can\\nsamplext=p\\u0016\\u000btx0+p1\\u0000\\u0016\\u000bt\\u000ft, where\\u000ft\\u0018N(0;I).\\nDiffusion models are trained to learn the reverse process\\nthat inverts forward process corruptions: p\\u0012(xt\\u00001jxt) =\\nN(\\u0016\\u0012(xt);\\u0006\\u0012(xt)), where neural networks are used to pre-\\ndict the statistics of p\\u0012. The reverse process model is\\ntrained with the variational lower bound [30] of the log-\\nlikelihood of x0, which reduces to L(\\u0012) =\\u0000p(x0jx1) +P\\ntDKL(q\\u0003(xt\\u00001jxt;x0)jjp\\u0012(xt\\u00001jxt)), excluding an ad-\\nditional term irrelevant for training. Since both q\\u0003andp\\u0012\\nare Gaussian,DKLcan be evaluated with the mean and co-\\nvariance of the two distributions. By reparameterizing \\u0016\\u0012as\\na noise prediction network \\u000f\\u0012, the model can be trained us-\\ning simple mean-squared error between the predicted noise\\n\\u000f\\u0012(xt)and the ground truth sampled Gaussian noise \\u000ft:\\nLsimple (\\u0012) =jj\\u000f\\u0012(xt)\\u0000\\u000ftjj2\\n2. But, in order to train diffu-\\nsion models with a learned reverse process covariance \\u0006\\u0012,\\nthe fullDKLterm needs to be optimized. We follow Nichol\\nand Dhariwal\u2019s approach [36]: train \\u000f\\u0012withLsimple , and\\ntrain\\u0006\\u0012with the fullL. Oncep\\u0012is trained, new images can\\nbe sampled by initializing xtmax\\u0018 N (0;I)and sampling\\nxt\\u00001\\u0018p\\u0012(xt\\u00001jxt)via the reparameterization trick.\\n3\\n\\n=== Page 4 ===\\nClassi\ufb01er-free guidance. Conditional diffusion models\\ntake extra information as input, such as a class label c.\\nIn this case, the reverse process becomes p\\u0012(xt\\u00001jxt;c),\\nwhere\\u000f\\u0012and\\u0006\\u0012are conditioned on c. In this setting,\\nclassi\ufb01er-free guidance can be used to encourage the sam-\\npling procedure to \ufb01nd xsuch that logp(cjx)is high [21].\\nBy Bayes Rule, logp(cjx)/logp(xjc)\\u0000logp(x), and\\nhencerxlogp(cjx)/rxlogp(xjc)\\u0000rxlogp(x). By in-\\nterpreting the output of diffusion models as the score func-\\ntion, the DDPM sampling procedure can be guided to sam-\\nplexwith highp(xjc)by:^\\u000f\\u0012(xt;c) =\\u000f\\u0012(xt;;) +s\\u0001\\nrxlogp(xjc)/\\u000f\\u0012(xt;;)+s\\u0001(\\u000f\\u0012(xt;c)\\u0000\\u000f\\u0012(xt;;)), where\\ns>1indicates the scale of the guidance (note that s= 1re-\\ncovers standard sampling). Evaluating the diffusion model\\nwithc=;is done by randomly dropping out cduring\\ntraining and replacing it with a learned \u201cnull\u201d embedding\\n;. Classi\ufb01er-free guidance is widely-known to yield sig-\\nni\ufb01cantly improved samples over generic sampling tech-\\nniques [21, 35, 46], and the trend holds for our DiT models.\\nLatent diffusion models. Training diffusion models di-\\nrectly in high-resolution pixel space can be computationally\\nprohibitive. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) [48] tackle this\\nissue with a two-stage approach: (1) learn an autoencoder\\nthat compresses images into smaller spatial representations\\nwith a learned encoder E; (2) train a diffusion model of\\nrepresentations z=E(x)instead of a diffusion model of\\nimagesx(Eis frozen). New images can then be generated\\nby sampling a representation zfrom the diffusion model\\nand subsequently decoding it to an image with the learned\\ndecoderx=D(z).\\nAs shown in Figure 2, LDMs achieve good performance\\nwhile using a fraction of the G\ufb02ops of pixel space diffusion\\nmodels like ADM. Since we are concerned with compute\\nef\ufb01ciency, this makes them an appealing starting point for\\narchitecture exploration. In this paper, we apply DiTs to\\nlatent space, although they could be applied to pixel space\\nwithout modi\ufb01cation as well. This makes our image genera-\\ntion pipeline a hybrid-based approach; we use off-the-shelf\\nconvolutional V AEs and transformer-based DDPMs.\\n3.2. Diffusion Transformer Design Space\\nWe introduce Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), a new ar-\\nchitecture for diffusion models. We aim to be as faithful to\\nthe standard transformer architecture as possible to retain\\nits scaling properties. Since our focus is training DDPMs of\\nimages (speci\ufb01cally, spatial representations of images), DiT\\nis based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture which\\noperates on sequences of patches [10]. DiT retains many of\\nthe best practices of ViTs. Figure 3 shows an overview of\\nthe complete DiT architecture. In this section, we describe\\nthe forward pass of DiT, as well as the components of the\\ndesign space of the DiT class.\\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc47=\ud835\udc3c/\ud835\udc5d!Noised LatentI\u00d7I\u00d7CInput Tokens T\u00d7dDiTBlockFigure 4.

The input to DiT is a spatial representation z\\n(for256\\u0002256\\u00023images,zhas shape 32\\u000232\\u00024). The\\n\ufb01rst layer of DiT is \u201cpatchify,\u201d which converts the spatial\\ninput into a sequence of Ttokens, each of dimension d,\\nby linearly embedding each patch in the input. Following\\npatchify, we apply standard ViT frequency-based positional\\nembeddings (the sine-cosine version) to all input tokens.\\nThe number of tokens Tcreated by patchify is determined\\nby the patch size hyperparameter p.

Following patchify, the input tokens\\nare processed by a sequence of transformer blocks. In ad-\\ndition to noised image inputs, diffusion models sometimes\\nprocess additional conditional information such as noise\\ntimestepst, class labels c, natural language, etc. We explore\\nfour variants of transformer blocks that process conditional\\ninputs differently. The designs introduce small, but impor-\\ntant, modi\ufb01cations to the standard ViT block design. The\\ndesigns of all blocks are shown in Figure 3.\\n\u2013In-context conditioning. We simply append the vec-\\ntor embeddings of tandcas two additional tokens in\\nthe input sequence, treating them no differently from\\nthe image tokens. This is similar to cls tokens in\\nViTs, and it allows us to use standard ViT blocks with-\\nout modi\ufb01cation. After the \ufb01nal block, we remove the\\nconditioning tokens from the sequence. This approach\\nintroduces negligible new G\ufb02ops to the model.\\n4\\n\\n=== Page 5 ===\\n100K 200K 300K 400K\\nTraining Steps20406080100FID-50K\\nXL/2 In-Context\\nXL/2 Cross-Attention\\nXL/2 adaLN\\nXL/2 adaLN-ZeroFigure 5.

The transformer block is\\nmodi\ufb01ed to include an additional multi-head cross-\\nattention layer following the multi-head self-attention\\nblock, similar to the original design from Vaswani et\\nal.[60], and also similar to the one used by LDM for\\nconditioning on class labels. Cross-attention adds the\\nmost G\ufb02ops to the model, roughly a 15% overhead.\\n\u2013Adaptive layer norm (adaLN) block. Following\\nthe widespread usage of adaptive normalization lay-\\ners [40] in GANs [2, 28] and diffusion models with U-\\nNet backbones [9], we explore replacing standard layer\\nnorm layers in transformer blocks with adaptive layer\\nnorm (adaLN). Rather than directly learn dimension-\\nwise scale and shift parameters \\rand\\f, we regress\\nthem from the sum of the embedding vectors of tand\\nc. Of the three block designs we explore, adaLN adds\\nthe least G\ufb02ops and is thus the most compute-ef\ufb01cient.\\nIt is also the only conditioning mechanism that is re-\\nstricted to apply the same function to all tokens.\\n\u2013adaLN-Zero block. Prior work on ResNets has found\\nthat initializing each residual block as the identity\\nfunction is bene\ufb01cial. For example, Goyal et al. found\\nthat zero-initializing the \ufb01nal batch norm scale factor \\r\\nin each block accelerates large-scale training in the su-\\npervised learning setting [13]. Diffusion U-Net mod-\\nels use a similar initialization strategy, zero-initializing\\nthe \ufb01nal convolutional layer in each block prior to any\\nresidual connections. We explore a modi\ufb01cation of\\nthe adaLN DiT block which does the same. In addi-\\ntion to regressing \\rand\\f, we also regress dimension-\\nwise scaling parameters \\u000bthat are applied immediately\\nprior to any residual connections within the DiT block.Model Layers N Hidden size dHeads G\ufb02ops (I=32,p=4)\\nDiT-S 12 384 6 1.4\\nDiT-B 12 768 12 5.6\\nDiT-L 24 1024 16 19.7\\nDiT-XL 28 1152 16 29.1\\nTable 1.

They cover a\\nwide range of model sizes and \ufb02op allocations, from 0.3\\nto 118.6 G\ufb02ops, allowing us to gauge scaling performance.\\nTable 1 gives details of the con\ufb01gs.\\nWe add B, S, L and XL con\ufb01gs to the DiT design space.\\nTransformer decoder. After the \ufb01nal DiT block, we need\\nto decode our sequence of image tokens into an output noise\\nprediction and an output diagonal covariance prediction.\\nBoth of these outputs have shape equal to the original spa-\\ntial input.

This \u201cnext-token prediction\u201d\\nparadigm presents unprecedented capabilities in solving language tasks in a human-like conversational\\nmanner [Ouyang et al. 2022; OpenAI 2022, 2023b; Google 2023; Anthropic 2023; Workshop et al.\\n2022; Touvron et al. 2023a,b; Bai et al. 2023a; Yang et al. 2023; Team 2023; Bi et al. 2024] and\\nincredible scalability [Kaplan et al. 2020; Henighan et al. 2020; Hoffmann et al. 2022; Wei et al. 2022;\\nAlabdulmohsin et al. 2022; Chowdhery et al. 2023; Anil et al. 2023], demonstrating a promising path\\ntoward general-purpose artificial intelligence models.\\nWitnessed the scalability of autoregressive models on large language models, pioneering works\\nattempt to explore autoregressive models in image generation, for example, VQV AE [Van Den Oord\\net al. 2017; Razavi et al. 2019], VQGAN [Esser et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2022], DALL-E [Ramesh et al.\\n2021], Parti [Yu et al. 2021, 2022]. They introduce image tokenizers to convert continuous images to\\ndiscrete tokens, and apply autoregressive models to generate image tokens in the way of next-token\\nprediction. They demonstrate strong performance among their contemporaries [Brock et al. 2018;\\nHo et al. 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol 2021] in the year before 2022. However, their open-source\\ncommunities are not well developed, which largely limits their further improvements.\\nAt the same period, another image generation method, diffusion models [Song & Ermon 2019; Ho\\net al. 2020; Song et al. 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol 2021; Nichol et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2022a; Ho\\net al. 2022a; Ho & Salimans 2022; Rombach et al. 2022; Ramesh et al. 2022; Saharia et al. 2022;\\nRombach et al. 2022] develop rapidly. Along with their open-source communities, they dominate\\nthe field of visual generation up to today. However, diffusion models share distinct paradigms with\\nautoregressive language models, which poses a huge challenge to building a unified model between\\nlanguage and vision.\\nIn this work, we are committed to pushing the envelope of autoregressive models on image generation\\nfurther: continuing its research methodology and contributing to open-source community. Reviewing\\nthe literature on image generation in the year before 2024, we identify three keys to existing advanced\\nmodels [Peebles & Xie 2023; Podell et al. 2023; Xue et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023b,c; Betker et al.\\n2023; Li et al. 2024; Esser et al. 2024]: 1) well-designed image compressors, 2) scalable image\\ngeneration models and 3) high-quality training data. Motivated by this, we reexamine the designs of\\nimage tokenizers (image compressors for autoregressive models), the scalability properties of image\\ngeneration models, and the effects of training data.\\nTowards a potential unified model between language and vision, our design is reducing the inductive\\nbiases on visual signals and adopting the same architecture as LLM. This belongs to a different re-\\nsearch philosophy with recent works [Chang et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2023b; Tian et al. 2024] that modify\\nthe architectures under the guidance of vision-oriented designs. For example, MaskGIT [Chang et al.\\n2022], MAGVIT [Yu et al. 2023a,b] adopt the masked image modeling strategy, V AR [Tian et al.\\n2024] uses hierarchical multi-scale property. Although they have succeeded in achieving leading\\nimage generation performance, and even better than diffusion models, it is still not clear whether\\nthe original language model architectures are capable of this. Instead, our work reveals that vanilla\\nautoregressive models that apply the exactly same \u201cnext-token prediction\u201d as language models are\\nalso able to achieve state-of-the-art image generation performance. As a bonus, we can leverage the\\ntechniques [Dao et al. 2022; Rasley et al. 2020; Shoeybi et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2023; Kwon et al.\\n2023; Chen et al. 2023a; Dettmers 2022] developed in LLM community to optimize the training\\nrecipes and inference speeds of our models.\\nIn summary, our contributions to the community include:\\n1.Image tokenizer: An image tokenizer with downsample ratio of 16, achieves reconstruction\\nquality of 0.94 rFID and codebook usage of 97% on ImageNet benchmark. With the downsample\\nratio of 8, our tokenizer is competitive or even better than continuous V AE [Rombach et al.\\n2022; Podell et al. 2023; OpenAI 2023a] used in diffusion models. This shows that discrete\\nrepresentation in image tokenizers is no longer the bottleneck of the image reconstruction.\\n2.Scalable image generation model: A series of class-conditional image generation models,\\nranging from 111M to 3.1B parameters, are developed based on Llama architecture [Touvron\\n2\\n\\n=== Page 3 ===\\net al. 2023a,b]. The largest model realizes 2.18 FID on ImageNet 256 \u00d7256 benchmarks,\\noutperforming the popular diffusion models such as LDM [Rombach et al. 2022], DiT [Peebles\\n& Xie 2023]. This shows that vanilla autoregressive models without inductive biases on visual\\nsignals can serve as the basis of image generation systems.\\n3.Hiqh-quality training data: A text-conditional image generation model with 775M parameters,\\nis firstly trained on a 50M subset of LAION-COCO [LAION 2022] and then fine-tuned on\\n10M internal high aesthetics quality images. It demonstrates competitive performance of visual\\nquality and text alignment.\\n4.Optimized inference speed: We adopt vLLM [Kwon et al. 2023], one of the most popular\\nLLM serving frameworks, to optimize the inference speed of our image generation models, and\\nremarkable 326% - 414% speedup is achieved.\\nWe release all models and codes to facilitate the open-source community of visual generation and\\nmultimodal foundation models. It is worth noticing that our released models are still behind state-of-\\nthe-art visual generation models based on diffusion models [Alpha-VLLM 2024; Esser et al. 2024;\\nBrooks et al. 2024]. When more training data and computation resources are available in the future,\\nlarge-scale AR-based visual generation models, e.g., above 7B parameters, will be explored.\\n2 Autoregressive Models for Image Generation\\n2.1 Overview\\nFirstly, image pixels x\u2208RH\u00d7W\u00d73are quantized into q\u2208Qh\u00d7wdiscrete tokens by the image\\ntokenizer [Van Den Oord et al. 2017; Esser et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2021], where h=H/p,w=W/p ,\\npis downsample ratio of the image tokenizer, q(i,j)is indices of the image codebook. Then, these\\nimage tokens are reshaped to a sequence of h\u00b7wtokens in raster scan ordering and used to train\\nTransformer [Vaswani et al. 2017]-based autoregressive models.\\nDuring image generation, image tokens (q1, q2, . . . , q h\u00b7w)are generated by autoregressive mod-\\nels [Radford et al. 2018, 2019; Brown et al. 2020; Touvron et al. 2023a] in the way of next-token\\npredictionQh\u00b7w\\nt=1p(qt|q<t, c), where cis class label embedding or text embedding. Finally, these\\nimage tokens are converted to image pixels by the image tokenizer decoder.\\n2.2 Image Tokenizer\\nQuantized-Autoencoder architecture. We use the same architecture as VQGAN [Esser et al.\\n2021], encoder-quantizer-decoder. The encoder and the decoder are ConvNet with downsample ratio\\np. The quantizer contains a codebook Z\u2208RK\u00d7CwithKlearnable vectors. The encoder projects\\nimage pixels xto the feature map f. The quantization process maps each vector f(i,j)in the feature\\nmap to the code index q(i,j)of its nearest vector z(i,j)in the codebook. During decoding, the code\\nindex q(i,j)is remapped to the feature vector z(i,j)and the decoder converts these feature vectors\\nback to the image pixels \u02c6x.\\nThe codebook has critical effects on image tokenization performance. Following [Yu et al. 2021], we\\nuse\u21132-normalization to codebook vectors, low codebook vector dimension C, and large codebook\\nsizeK. These designs significantly improve reconstruction quality and codebook usage. More details\\nwill be discussed in experiments.\\nTraining losses. Since quantization is a non-differentiable operation, a straight-through gradient\\nestimator [Bengio et al. 2013] is used to preserve the gradient from the decoder to the encoder\\nz=sg[z\u2212f] +f,sg[\u00b7]is stop-gradient operation. For codebook learning, LVQ=\u2225sg[f]\u2212z\u22252\\n2+\\n\u03b2\u2225f\u2212sg[z]\u22252\\n2, where the second term is commitment loss [Van Den Oord et al. 2017] to force feature\\nvectors extracted from the encoder to be close to codebook vectors, \u03b2is commitment loss weight.\\nFor simplicity, we don\u2019t add entropy loss [Yu et al. 2023a; Chang et al. 2022] in codebook learning.\\nFor image reconstruction training, LAE=\u21132(x,\u02c6x)+LP(x,\u02c6x)+\u03bbGLG(\u02c6x), where \u21132is a reconstruction\\nloss on image pixels, LP(\u00b7)is a perceptual loss from LPIPS [Zhang et al. 2018], LG(\u00b7)is an adversarial\\nloss from a PatchGAN [Isola et al. 2017] discriminator trained at the same time with the image\\ntokenizer, and \u03bbGis adversarial loss weight.\\n3\\n\\n=== Page 4 ===\\nModel Parameters Layers Hidden Size Heads\\nLlamaGen-B 111M 12 768 12\\nLlamaGen-L 343M 24 1024 16\\nLlamaGen-XL 775M 36 1280 20\\nLlamaGen-XXL 1.4B 48 1536 24\\nLlamaGen-3B 3.1B 24 3200 32\\nTable 1: Model sizes and architecture configurations of LlamaGen.

Our model architecture is largely based on Llama [Touvron et al. 2023a,b],\\napplying pre-normalization using RMSNorm [Zhang & Sennrich 2019], SwiGLU activation func-\\ntion [Shazeer 2020], and rotary positional embeddings [Su et al. 2024]. Specifically, we use 2D RoPE\\nin at each layer of our model, following the implementation of [Lu et al. 2023; Fang et al. 2023]. We\\ndo not use the technique of AdaLN [Peebles & Xie 2023] to keep our structure the same as LLM.\\nClass-conditional image generation. The class embedding is indexed from a set of learnable\\nembeddings [Peebles & Xie 2023; Esser et al. 2021] and is used as the prefilling token embedding.\\nStarting from this token embedding, the model generates the sequence of image tokens by next-token\\nprediction way, and stops at the location of the pre-defined maximum length.\\nText-conditional image generation. To integrate the text condition into autoregressive models, we\\nuse FLAN-T5 XL [Chung et al. 2024] as the text encoder, the encoded text feature is projected by an\\nadditional MLP [Chen et al. 2023b,c] and is used as prefilling token embedding in autoregressive\\nmodels. We note that this design is not an ultimate design for multimodal foundation models, where\\na unified vocabulary is established between language and vision [Lu et al. 2023; Team et al. 2023].\\nWe leave it for future research.\\nClassifier-free guidance. Developed in the diffusion model community, classifier-free guidance [Ho\\n& Salimans 2022] is well-known for its improving visual quality and text-image alignment. We adopt\\nit in our models. During training, the conditional is randomly dropped and is replaced by a null\\nunconditional embedding [Peebles & Xie 2023; Chen et al. 2023b]. In inference, for each token, its\\nlogit\u2113gis formed by \u2113g=\u2113u+s(\u2113c\u2212\u2113u), where \u2113cis conditional logit, \u2113uis unconditional logit,\\nandsis scale of the classifier-free guidance.\\nIt is worth noting that all design choices discussed so far are largely inspired by previous works, for\\nexample, image tokenizer is borrowed from [Rombach et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2021], image generation\\nis from [Peebles & Xie 2023; Chen et al. 2023b; Esser et al. 2021]. A large portion of these techniques\\nare well studied in diffusion models but little in AR models. Our work adapts these advanced designs\\ncollectively to AR-based visual generation models.\\n2.4 Scale Up\\nOur model architecture is almost the same as Llama, which allows us to seamlessly adopt optimization\\ntechniques [Zhang & Sennrich 2019; Shazeer 2020; Su et al. 2024] and training recipes [Dao et al.\\n2022; Rasley et al. 2020; Shoeybi et al. 2019] in LLM community. As shown in Table 1, we scale the\\nmodel size up to 3.1B parameters in this work. All models are implemented with PyTorch 2 [Ansel\\net al. 2024] and trained on 80GB A100 GPUs. For training the models with parameters below 1.4B,\\nwe directly use DDP, otherwise, we adopt PyTorch FSDP [Zhao et al. 2023] to optimize GPU memory\\nusage.\\n2.5 Serving\\nAutoregressive models have always suffered from its low inference speed. With the rapid development\\nof large language models, advanced inference techniques [Kwon et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023a;\\nDettmers 2022] are proposed in the LLM community to optimize the inference speed.\\n4\\n\\n=== Page 5 ===\\nSimilar to training, inference techniques developed in the LLM community can also be adopted to\\noptimize our models. We verify the effectiveness of vLLM [Kwon et al. 2023], one of the most\\npopular LLM serving frameworks, on our image generation methods. As shown in Table 7, 326% -\\n414% speedup is achieved compared to the baseline setting.\\n3 Experiments\\n3.1 Image Tokenizer\\nTraining setup. The training is on ImageNet [Deng et al. 2009] train set, using the resolution of\\n256\u00d7256 and random crop data augmentation. The image tokenizer model size is 72M and 70M\\nwhen the downsample ratio is 16 and 8, respectively. All models are trained with the same settings:\\nconstant learning rate of 10\u22124, AdamW optimizer with \u03b21= 0.9,\u03b22= 0.95, weight decay = 0.05,\\nbatch size of 128 and training epochs of 40. For the training losses, commitment loss weight is 0.25\\nand adversarial loss weight is 0.5. The adversarial loss is enabled after 20k training iterations.\\nEvaluation metrics. We use the popular ImageNet benchmark under the image resolution of 256\\n\u00d7256. The image reconstruction quality is measured by r-FID, reconstruction-FID on 256 \u00d7256\\nImageNet 50k validation set. The codebook usage is calculated as the percentage of used codes in the\\nqueue of size 65536 over the whole codebook size. We also report PSNR and SSIM as the metrics of\\nreconstruction quality, following SDXL [Podell et al. 2023].\\ndim rFID\u2193PSNR\u2191SSIM\u2191usage\u2191\\n256 9.21 18.32 0.575 0.29%\\n32 3.22 19.98 0.646 20.9%\\n8 2.19 20.79 0.675 97.0%\\n4 9.88 19.39 0.593 82.0%\\n(a)Codebook vector dimension.

The default setting is codebook vector dimension is 8, codebook\\nsize is 16384.\\nEffect of image codebook designs. As shown in Table 2, when the codebook vector dimension is\\nreduced from 256 to 32 to 8, much better reconstruction quality and codebook usage are consistently\\nachieved. For codebook size, a larger size from 4096 to 16384 benefits the overall performance.\\nThese observations are consistent with previous works [Yu et al. 2021, 2023b].\\nEffect of number of tokens to represent the image.

Using the same image tokenizer, for example, downsample\\nratio as 16, representing an image with only 256 tokens (16 \u00d716) is not sufficient for good reconstruc-\\ntion quality, and increasing the number of tokens to 576 (24 \u00d724) could largely improve the image\\nquality from 2.43 to 0.99 rFID.\\n5\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "tool_0_pdf-tools-read_pdf_pages_MI7ikTtjmt6AMFsysPvg"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "tool_0_filesystem-write_file_mgIhRTGWZNeKYeKhSEMk", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "filesystem-write_file", "arguments": "{\"path\":\"/workspace/dumps/workspace/survey.tex\",\"content\":\"\\\\begin{table}[!ht]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\\n        \\\\toprule\\n        Model & Class & \\\\#Param & FID-50K & Inception Score \\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\midrule\\n        DiT-XL/2 & Diffusion & 675M & 2.27 & 278.24 \\\\\\\\\\n        LlamaGen-3B & AR & 3.1B & 2.18 & 290.1 \\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\bottomrule\\n    \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{table}\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Successfully wrote to /workspace/dumps/workspace/survey.tex\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "tool_0_filesystem-write_file_mgIhRTGWZNeKYeKhSEMk"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have summarized the experimental results of the models in the papers you provided and created a LaTeX table as you requested.
