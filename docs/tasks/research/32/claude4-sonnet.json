Introduction\\nMachine learning is experiencing a renaissance powered\\nby transformers. Over the past \ufb01ve years, neural architec-\\ntures for natural language processing [8, 42], vision [10]\\nand several other domains have largely been subsumed by\\ntransformers [60]. Many classes of image-level genera-\\ntive models remain holdouts to the trend, though\u2014while\\ntransformers see widespread use in autoregressive mod-\\nels [3,6,43,47], they have seen less adoption in other gener-\\native modeling frameworks. For example, diffusion models\\nhave been at the forefront of recent advances in image-level\\ngenerative models [9,46]; yet, they all adopt a convolutional\\nU-Net architecture as the de-facto choice of backbone.\\n*Work done during an internship at Meta AI, FAIR Team.\\nCode and project page available here.\\n1arXiv:2212.09748v2  [cs.CV]  2 Mar 2023\\n\\n=== Page 2 ===\\n520 80 320GflopsDiameterFigure 2. ImageNet generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Bubble area indicates the \ufb02ops of the diffusion model. Left:\\nFID-50K (lower is better) of our DiT models at 400K training iterations. Performance steadily improves in FID as model \ufb02ops increase.\\nRight: Our best model, DiT-XL/2, is compute-ef\ufb01cient and outperforms all prior U-Net-based diffusion models, like ADM and LDM.\\nThe seminal work of Ho et al. [19] \ufb01rst introduced the\\nU-Net backbone for diffusion models. Having initially seen\\nsuccess within pixel-level autoregressive models and con-\\nditional GANs [23], the U-Net was inherited from Pixel-\\nCNN++ [52, 58] with a few changes. The model is con-\\nvolutional, comprised primarily of ResNet [15] blocks. In\\ncontrast to the standard U-Net [49], additional spatial self-\\nattention blocks, which are essential components in trans-\\nformers, are interspersed at lower resolutions. Dhariwal and\\nNichol [9] ablated several architecture choices for the U-\\nNet, such as the use of adaptive normalization layers [40] to\\ninject conditional information and channel counts for con-\\nvolutional layers. However, the high-level design of the U-\\nNet from Ho et al. has largely remained intact.\\nWith this work, we aim to demystify the signi\ufb01cance of\\narchitectural choices in diffusion models and offer empiri-\\ncal baselines for future generative modeling research. We\\nshow that the U-Net inductive bias is notcrucial to the per-\\nformance of diffusion models, and they can be readily re-\\nplaced with standard designs such as transformers. As a\\nresult, diffusion models are well-poised to bene\ufb01t from the\\nrecent trend of architecture uni\ufb01cation\u2014e.g., by inheriting\\nbest practices and training recipes from other domains, as\\nwell as retaining favorable properties like scalability, ro-\\nbustness and ef\ufb01ciency. A standardized architecture would\\nalso open up new possibilities for cross-domain research.\\nIn this paper, we focus on a new class of diffusion models\\nbased on transformers. We call them Diffusion Transform-\\ners, or DiTs for short. DiTs adhere to the best practices of\\nVision Transformers (ViTs) [10], which have been shown to\\nscale more effectively for visual recognition than traditional\\nconvolutional networks (e.g., ResNet [15]).More speci\ufb01cally, we study the scaling behavior of trans-\\nformers with respect to network complexity vs. sample\\nquality . We show that by constructing and benchmark-\\ning the DiT design space under the Latent Diffusion Mod-\\nels(LDMs) [48] framework, where diffusion models are\\ntrained within a V AE\u2019s latent space, we can successfully\\nreplace the U-Net backbone with a transformer. We further\\nshow that DiTs are scalable architectures for diffusion mod-\\nels: there is a strong correlation between the network com-\\nplexity (measured by G\ufb02ops) vs. sample quality (measured\\nby FID). By simply scaling-up DiT and training an LDM\\nwith a high-capacity backbone (118.6 G\ufb02ops), we are able\\nto achieve a state-of-the-art result of 2.27 FID on the class-\\nconditional 256\\u0002256ImageNet generation benchmark.\\n2. Related Work\\nTransformers. Transformers [60] have replaced domain-\\nspeci\ufb01c architectures across language, vision [10], rein-\\nforcement learning [5, 25] and meta-learning [39]. They\\nhave shown remarkable scaling properties under increas-\\ning model size, training compute and data in the language\\ndomain [26], as generic autoregressive models [17] and\\nas ViTs [63]. Beyond language, transformers have been\\ntrained to autoregressively predict pixels [6, 7, 38]. They\\nhave also been trained on discrete codebooks [59] as both\\nautoregressive models [11,47] and masked generative mod-\\nels [4, 14]; the former has shown excellent scaling behavior\\nup to 20B parameters [62]. Finally, transformers have been\\nexplored in DDPMs to synthesize non-spatial data; e.g., to\\ngenerate CLIP image embeddings in DALL \\u0001E 2 [41,46]. In\\nthis paper, we study the scaling properties of transformers\\nwhen used as the backbone of diffusion models of images.\\n2\\n\\n=== Page 3 ===\\nMulti-Head Self-AttentionLayer NormScale, ShiftMLPPointwise FeedforwardLayer NormScale, ShiftScale++\\nScale\ud835\udefe!,\ud835\udefd!\ud835\udefc!\ud835\udefe\\\",\ud835\udefd\\\"\ud835\udefc\\\"\\nInput TokensConditioningDiTBlock with adaLN-ZeroLatent Diffusion TransformerTimestep \ud835\udc61Label \ud835\udc66DiTBlockN xPatchifyLayer NormLinear and ReshapeEmbedNoise\u03a332 x 32 x 432 x 32 x 4\\nNoised Latent32 x 32 x 4Multi-Head Self-AttentionLayer NormPointwise Feedforward\\nLayer Norm++\\nInput TokensConditioningDiTBlock with Cross-AttentionMulti-Head Cross-AttentionLayer Norm+Multi-Head Self-AttentionLayer NormPointwise Feedforward++\\nInput TokensConditioningDiTBlock with In-Context ConditioningLayer Norm\\nConcatenate on Sequence DimensionFigure 3.

Right: Details of our DiT blocks. We experiment with variants of standard transformer\\nblocks that incorporate conditioning via adaptive layer norm, cross-attention and extra input tokens. Adaptive layer norm works best.\\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs).\\nDiffusion [19, 54] and score-based generative models [22,\\n56] have been particularly successful as generative models\\nof images [35,46,48,50], in many cases outperforming gen-\\nerative adversarial networks (GANs) [12] which had previ-\\nously been state-of-the-art. Improvements in DDPMs over\\nthe past two years have largely been driven by improved\\nsampling techniques [19, 27, 55], most notably classi\ufb01er-\\nfree guidance [21], reformulating diffusion models to pre-\\ndict noise instead of pixels [19] and using cascaded DDPM\\npipelines where low-resolution base diffusion models are\\ntrained in parallel with upsamplers [9, 20]. For all the dif-\\nfusion models listed above, convolutional U-Nets [49] are\\nthe de-facto choice of backbone architecture. Concurrent\\nwork [24] introduced a novel, ef\ufb01cient architecture based\\non attention for DDPMs; we explore pure transformers.\\nArchitecture complexity. When evaluating architecture\\ncomplexity in the image generation literature, it is fairly\\ncommon practice to use parameter counts. In general, pa-\\nrameter counts can be poor proxies for the complexity of\\nimage models since they do not account for, e.g., image res-\\nolution which signi\ufb01cantly impacts performance [44, 45].\\nInstead, much of the model complexity analysis in this pa-\\nper is through the lens of theoretical G\ufb02ops. This brings us\\nin-line with the architecture design literature where G\ufb02ops\\nare widely-used to gauge complexity. In practice, the\\ngolden complexity metric is still up for debate as it fre-\\nquently depends on particular application scenarios. Nichol\\nand Dhariwal\u2019s seminal work improving diffusion mod-\\nels [9, 36] is most related to us\u2014there, they analyzed the\\nscalability and G\ufb02op properties of the U-Net architecture\\nclass. In this paper, we focus on the transformer class.3. Diffusion Transformers\\n3.1. Preliminaries\\nDiffusion formulation. Before introducing our architec-\\nture, we brie\ufb02y review some basic concepts needed to\\nunderstand diffusion models (DDPMs) [19, 54]. Gaus-\\nsian diffusion models assume a forward noising process\\nwhich gradually applies noise to real data x0:q(xtjx0) =\\nN(xt;p\\u0016\\u000btx0;(1\\u0000\\u0016\\u000bt)I), where constants \\u0016\\u000btare hyperpa-\\nrameters. By applying the reparameterization trick, we can\\nsamplext=p\\u0016\\u000btx0+p1\\u0000\\u0016\\u000bt\\u000ft, where\\u000ft\\u0018N(0;I).\\nDiffusion models are trained to learn the reverse process\\nthat inverts forward process corruptions: p\\u0012(xt\\u00001jxt) =\\nN(\\u0016\\u0012(xt);\\u0006\\u0012(xt)), where neural networks are used to pre-\\ndict the statistics of p\\u0012. The reverse process model is\\ntrained with the variational lower bound [30] of the log-\\nlikelihood of x0, which reduces to L(\\u0012) =\\u0000p(x0jx1) +P\\ntDKL(q\\u0003(xt\\u00001jxt;x0)jjp\\u0012(xt\\u00001jxt)), excluding an ad-\\nditional term irrelevant for training. Since both q\\u0003andp\\u0012\\nare Gaussian,DKLcan be evaluated with the mean and co-\\nvariance of the two distributions. By reparameterizing \\u0016\\u0012as\\na noise prediction network \\u000f\\u0012, the model can be trained us-\\ning simple mean-squared error between the predicted noise\\n\\u000f\\u0012(xt)and the ground truth sampled Gaussian noise \\u000ft:\\nLsimple (\\u0012) =jj\\u000f\\u0012(xt)\\u0000\\u000ftjj2\\n2. But, in order to train diffu-\\nsion models with a learned reverse process covariance \\u0006\\u0012,\\nthe fullDKLterm needs to be optimized.

They introduce image tokenizers to convert continuous images to\\ndiscrete tokens, and apply autoregressive models to generate image tokens in the way of next-token\\nprediction. They demonstrate strong performance among their contemporaries [Brock et al. 2018;\\nHo et al. 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol 2021] in the year before 2022. However, their open-source\\ncommunities are not well developed, which largely limits their further improvements.\\nAt the same period, another image generation method, diffusion models [Song & Ermon 2019; Ho\\net al. 2020; Song et al. 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol 2021; Nichol et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2022a; Ho\\net al. 2022a; Ho & Salimans 2022; Rombach et al. 2022; Ramesh et al. 2022; Saharia et al. 2022;\\nRombach et al. 2022] develop rapidly. Along with their open-source communities, they dominate\\nthe field of visual generation up to today. However, diffusion models share distinct paradigms with\\nautoregressive language models, which poses a huge challenge to building a unified model between\\nlanguage and vision.\\nIn this work, we are committed to pushing the envelope of autoregressive models on image generation\\nfurther: continuing its research methodology and contributing to open-source community. Reviewing\\nthe literature on image generation in the year before 2024, we identify three keys to existing advanced\\nmodels [Peebles & Xie 2023; Podell et al. 2023; Xue et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023b,c; Betker et al.\\n2023; Li et al. 2024; Esser et al. 2024]: 1) well-designed image compressors, 2) scalable image\\ngeneration models and 3) high-quality training data. Motivated by this, we reexamine the designs of\\nimage tokenizers (image compressors for autoregressive models), the scalability properties of image\\ngeneration models, and the effects of training data.\\nTowards a potential unified model between language and vision, our design is reducing the inductive\\nbiases on visual signals and adopting the same architecture as LLM. This belongs to a different re-\\nsearch philosophy with recent works [Chang et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2023b; Tian et al. 2024] that modify\\nthe architectures under the guidance of vision-oriented designs. For example, MaskGIT [Chang et al.\\n2022], MAGVIT [Yu et al. 2023a,b] adopt the masked image modeling strategy, V AR [Tian et al.\\n2024] uses hierarchical multi-scale property. Although they have succeeded in achieving leading\\nimage generation performance, and even better than diffusion models, it is still not clear whether\\nthe original language model architectures are capable of this. Instead, our work reveals that vanilla\\nautoregressive models that apply the exactly same \u201cnext-token prediction\u201d as language models are\\nalso able to achieve state-of-the-art image generation performance. As a bonus, we can leverage the\\ntechniques [Dao et al. 2022; Rasley et al. 2020; Shoeybi et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2023; Kwon et al.\\n2023; Chen et al. 2023a; Dettmers 2022] developed in LLM community to optimize the training\\nrecipes and inference speeds of our models.\\nIn summary, our contributions to the community include:\\n1.Image tokenizer: An image tokenizer with downsample ratio of 16, achieves reconstruction\\nquality of 0.94 rFID and codebook usage of 97% on ImageNet benchmark. With the downsample\\nratio of 8, our tokenizer is competitive or even better than continuous V AE [Rombach et al.\\n2022; Podell et al. 2023; OpenAI 2023a] used in diffusion models. This shows that discrete\\nrepresentation in image tokenizers is no longer the bottleneck of the image reconstruction.\\n2.Scalable image generation model: A series of class-conditional image generation models,\\nranging from 111M to 3.1B parameters, are developed based on Llama architecture [Touvron\\n2\\n\\n=== Page 3 ===\\net al. 2023a,b]. The largest model realizes 2.18 FID on ImageNet 256 \u00d7256 benchmarks,\\noutperforming the popular diffusion models such as LDM [Rombach et al. 2022], DiT [Peebles\\n& Xie 2023]. This shows that vanilla autoregressive models without inductive biases on visual\\nsignals can serve as the basis of image generation systems.\\n3.Hiqh-quality training data: A text-conditional image generation model with 775M parameters,\\nis firstly trained on a 50M subset of LAION-COCO [LAION 2022] and then fine-tuned on\\n10M internal high aesthetics quality images. It demonstrates competitive performance of visual\\nquality and text alignment.\\n4.Optimized inference speed: We adopt vLLM [Kwon et al. 2023], one of the most popular\\nLLM serving frameworks, to optimize the inference speed of our image generation models, and\\nremarkable 326% - 414% speedup is achieved.\\nWe release all models and codes to facilitate the open-source community of visual generation and\\nmultimodal foundation models. It is worth noticing that our released models are still behind state-of-\\nthe-art visual generation models based on diffusion models [Alpha-VLLM 2024; Esser et al. 2024;\\nBrooks et al. 2024]. When more training data and computation resources are available in the future,\\nlarge-scale AR-based visual generation models, e.g., above 7B parameters, will be explored.\\n2 Autoregressive Models for Image Generation\\n2.1 Overview\\nFirstly, image pixels x\u2208RH\u00d7W\u00d73are quantized into q\u2208Qh\u00d7wdiscrete tokens by the image\\ntokenizer [Van Den Oord et al. 2017; Esser et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2021], where h=H/p,w=W/p ,\\npis downsample ratio of the image tokenizer, q(i,j)is indices of the image codebook. Then, these\\nimage tokens are reshaped to a sequence of h\u00b7wtokens in raster scan ordering and used to train\\nTransformer [Vaswani et al. 2017]-based autoregressive models.\\nDuring image generation, image tokens (q1, q2, . . . , q h\u00b7w)are generated by autoregressive mod-\\nels [Radford et al. 2018, 2019; Brown et al. 2020; Touvron et al. 2023a] in the way of next-token\\npredictionQh\u00b7w\\nt=1p(qt|q<t, c), where cis class label embedding or text embedding. Finally, these\\nimage tokens are converted to image pixels by the image tokenizer decoder.\\n2.2 Image Tokenizer\\nQuantized-Autoencoder architecture. We use the same architecture as VQGAN [Esser et al.\\n2021], encoder-quantizer-decoder. The encoder and the decoder are ConvNet with downsample ratio\\np. The quantizer contains a codebook Z\u2208RK\u00d7CwithKlearnable vectors. The encoder projects\\nimage pixels xto the feature map f. The quantization process maps each vector f(i,j)in the feature\\nmap to the code index q(i,j)of its nearest vector z(i,j)in the codebook. During decoding, the code\\nindex q(i,j)is remapped to the feature vector z(i,j)and the decoder converts these feature vectors\\nback to the image pixels \u02c6x.\\nThe codebook has critical effects on image tokenization performance. Following [Yu et al. 2021], we\\nuse\u21132-normalization to codebook vectors, low codebook vector dimension C, and large codebook\\nsizeK. These designs significantly improve reconstruction quality and codebook usage. More details\\nwill be discussed in experiments.\\nTraining losses. Since quantization is a non-differentiable operation, a straight-through gradient\\nestimator [Bengio et al. 2013] is used to preserve the gradient from the decoder to the encoder\\nz=sg[z\u2212f] +f,sg[\u00b7]is stop-gradient operation. For codebook learning, LVQ=\u2225sg[f]\u2212z\u22252\\n2+\\n\u03b2\u2225f\u2212sg[z]\u22252\\n2, where the second term is commitment loss [Van Den Oord et al. 2017] to force feature\\nvectors extracted from the encoder to be close to codebook vectors, \u03b2is commitment loss weight.\\nFor simplicity, we don\u2019t add entropy loss [Yu et al. 2023a; Chang et al. 2022] in codebook learning.\\nFor image reconstruction training, LAE=\u21132(x,\u02c6x)+LP(x,\u02c6x)+\u03bbGLG(\u02c6x), where \u21132is a reconstruction\\nloss on image pixels, LP(\u00b7)is a perceptual loss from LPIPS [Zhang et al. 2018], LG(\u00b7)is an adversarial\\nloss from a PatchGAN [Isola et al. 2017] discriminator trained at the same time with the image\\ntokenizer, and \u03bbGis adversarial loss weight.\\n3\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01VvQAfJZfi3RUA4uujqW5kz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now I need to search for experimental results sections in both papers to find the ImageNet 256 results.

Scaling Model vs. Sampling Compute\\nDiffusion models are unique in that they can use addi-\\ntional compute after training by increasing the number of\\nsampling steps when generating an image. Given the im-\\npact of model G\ufb02ops on sample quality, in this section we\\nstudy if smaller- model compute DiTs can outperform larger\\nones by using more sampling compute . We compute FID\\nfor all 12 of our DiT models after 400K training steps, us-\\ning [16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1000] sampling steps per-image.\\nThe main results are in Figure 10. Consider DiT-L/2 us-\\ning 1000 sampling steps versus DiT-XL/2 using 128 steps.\\nIn this case, L/2 uses 80:7T\ufb02ops to sample each image;\\nXL/2 uses 5\\u0002less compute\u2014 15:2T\ufb02ops\u2014to sample each\\nimage. Nonetheless, XL/2 has the better FID-10K (23.7\\nvs 25.9). In general, scaling-up sampling compute cannot\\ncompensate for a lack of model compute.\\n6. Conclusion\\nWe introduce Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), a simple\\ntransformer-based backbone for diffusion models that out-\\nperforms prior U-Net models and inherits the excellent scal-\\ning properties of the transformer model class. Given the\\npromising scaling results in this paper, future work should\\ncontinue to scale DiTs to larger models and token counts.\\nDiT could also be explored as a drop-in backbone for text-\\nto-image models like DALL \\u0001E 2 and Stable Diffusion.\\nAcknowledgements.

More detailed results are in Appendix.\\nEffect of classifier-free guidance (CFG). First, as shown in Figure 2, using classifier-free guidance\\ncan significantly enhance the visual quality across all model sizes. Moreover, Figure 3a illustrates\\nthat the model achieves optimal FID at CFG = 2.0 and further increasing CFG would deteriorate FID,\\nwhich is consistent with previous findings [Dhariwal & Nichol 2021]. Additionally, the increment in\\nCFG results in a trade-off between diversity and fidelity, as evidenced by increased precision and\\ndecreased recall, demonstrated in Table 10.\\nEffect of top-k sampling. As shown in Figure 3b, a small top-k value is not beneficial for FID\\nand IS. Increasing top-k continuously improves FID but decreases IS, which trades off fidelity for\\ndiversity. We observe a similar trend when changing the parameter of top-p and temperature in\\nsampling. Since FID is our main metric, we use maximum value as the default top-k value, which is\\nthe whole codebook size.\\nComparisons with other image generation methods. In Table 6, we compare with popular image\\ngeneration models, including GAN [Brock et al. 2018; Kang et al. 2023; Sauer et al. 2022], Diffusion\\nmodels [Dhariwal & Nichol 2021; Ho et al. 2022b; Rombach et al. 2022; Peebles & Xie 2023],\\nand masked-prediction models [Chang et al. 2022]. Our models exhibit competitive performance\\nin all metrics of FID, IS, Precision and Recall. Notably, our 3B model outperforms the popular\\ndiffusion models LDM [Rombach et al. 2022], DiT [Peebles & Xie 2023]. This shows that vanilla\\nautoregressive models can serve as the basis of advanced image generation systems.\\nWhen comparing with autoregressive models [Esser et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2022], our\\nmodel outperforms all previous models at different levels of model parameters. This benefits from\\nbetter designs of image tokenizers and better scalability of image generation models. We hope our\\nsimple and effective implementation will serve as a solid baseline and help facilitate future research\\nin autoregressive models for image generations.\\n8\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_012T8RXm1g9tNVxAQZkWcQHC"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now I need to search for parameter counts for the DiT models.

We concatenate the embeddings\\noftandcinto a length-two sequence, separate from\\nthe image token sequence. The transformer block is\\nmodi\ufb01ed to include an additional multi-head cross-\\nattention layer following the multi-head self-attention\\nblock, similar to the original design from Vaswani et\\nal.[60], and also similar to the one used by LDM for\\nconditioning on class labels. Cross-attention adds the\\nmost G\ufb02ops to the model, roughly a 15% overhead.\\n\u2013Adaptive layer norm (adaLN) block. Following\\nthe widespread usage of adaptive normalization lay-\\ners [40] in GANs [2, 28] and diffusion models with U-\\nNet backbones [9], we explore replacing standard layer\\nnorm layers in transformer blocks with adaptive layer\\nnorm (adaLN). Rather than directly learn dimension-\\nwise scale and shift parameters \\rand\\f, we regress\\nthem from the sum of the embedding vectors of tand\\nc. Of the three block designs we explore, adaLN adds\\nthe least G\ufb02ops and is thus the most compute-ef\ufb01cient.\\nIt is also the only conditioning mechanism that is re-\\nstricted to apply the same function to all tokens.\\n\u2013adaLN-Zero block. Prior work on ResNets has found\\nthat initializing each residual block as the identity\\nfunction is bene\ufb01cial. For example, Goyal et al. found\\nthat zero-initializing the \ufb01nal batch norm scale factor \\r\\nin each block accelerates large-scale training in the su-\\npervised learning setting [13]. Diffusion U-Net mod-\\nels use a similar initialization strategy, zero-initializing\\nthe \ufb01nal convolutional layer in each block prior to any\\nresidual connections. We explore a modi\ufb01cation of\\nthe adaLN DiT block which does the same. In addi-\\ntion to regressing \\rand\\f, we also regress dimension-\\nwise scaling parameters \\u000bthat are applied immediately\\nprior to any residual connections within the DiT block.Model Layers N Hidden size dHeads G\ufb02ops (I=32,p=4)\\nDiT-S 12 384 6 1.4\\nDiT-B 12 768 12 5.6\\nDiT-L 24 1024 16 19.7\\nDiT-XL 28 1152 16 29.1\\nTable 1.

As with the vanilla adaLN block, adaLN-\\nZero adds negligible G\ufb02ops to the model.\\nWe include the in-context, cross-attention, adaptive layer\\nnorm and adaLN-Zero blocks in the DiT design space.\\nModel size. We apply a sequence of NDiT blocks, each\\noperating at the hidden dimension size d. Following ViT,\\nwe use standard transformer con\ufb01gs that jointly scale N,\\ndand attention heads [10, 63]. Speci\ufb01cally, we use four\\ncon\ufb01gs: DiT-S, DiT-B, DiT-L and DiT-XL. They cover a\\nwide range of model sizes and \ufb02op allocations, from 0.3\\nto 118.6 G\ufb02ops, allowing us to gauge scaling performance.\\nTable 1 gives details of the con\ufb01gs.\\nWe add B, S, L and XL con\ufb01gs to the DiT design space.\\nTransformer decoder. After the \ufb01nal DiT block, we need\\nto decode our sequence of image tokens into an output noise\\nprediction and an output diagonal covariance prediction.\\nBoth of these outputs have shape equal to the original spa-\\ntial input. We use a standard linear decoder to do this; we\\napply the \ufb01nal layer norm (adaptive if using adaLN) and lin-\\nearly decode each token into a p\\u0002p\\u00022Ctensor, where Cis\\nthe number of channels in the spatial input to DiT. Finally,\\nwe rearrange the decoded tokens into their original spatial\\nlayout to get the predicted noise and covariance.\\nThe complete DiT design space we explore is patch size,\\ntransformer block architecture and model size.\\n4. Experimental Setup\\nWe explore the DiT design space and study the scaling\\nproperties of our model class. Our models are named ac-\\ncording to their con\ufb01gs and latent patch sizes p; for exam-\\nple, DiT-XL/2 refers to the XLarge con\ufb01g and p= 2.\\nTraining. We train class-conditional latent DiT models at\\n256\\u0002256 and512\\u0002512 image resolution on the Ima-\\ngeNet dataset [31], a highly-competitive generative mod-\\neling benchmark. We initialize the \ufb01nal linear layer with\\nzeros and otherwise use standard weight initialization tech-\\nniques from ViT. We train all models with AdamW [29,33].\\n5\\n\\n=== Page 6 ===\\nFigure 6. Scaling the DiT model improves FID at all stages of training. We show FID-50K over training iterations for 12 of our DiT\\nmodels. Top row: We compare FID holding patch size constant. Bottom row: We compare FID holding model size constant. Scaling the\\ntransformer backbone yields better generative models across all model sizes and patch sizes.\\nWe use a constant learning rate of 1\\u000210\\u00004, no weight de-\\ncay and a batch size of 256. The only data augmentation\\nwe use is horizontal \ufb02ips. Unlike much prior work with\\nViTs [57, 61], we did not \ufb01nd learning rate warmup nor\\nregularization necessary to train DiTs to high performance.\\nEven without these techniques, training was highly stable\\nacross all model con\ufb01gs and we did not observe any loss\\nspikes commonly seen when training transformers. Follow-\\ning common practice in the generative modeling literature,\\nwe maintain an exponential moving average (EMA) of DiT\\nweights over training with a decay of 0.9999. All results\\nreported use the EMA model. We use identical training hy-\\nperparameters across all DiT model sizes and patch sizes.\\nOur training hyperparameters are almost entirely retained\\nfrom ADM. We did not tune learning rates, decay/warm-up\\nschedules, Adam \\f1/\\f2or weight decays.\\nDiffusion. We use an off-the-shelf pre-trained variational\\nautoencoder (V AE) model [30] from Stable Diffusion [48].\\nThe V AE encoder has a downsample factor of 8\u2014given an\\nRGB image xwith shape 256\\u0002256\\u00023,z=E(x)has\\nshape 32\\u000232\\u00024. Across all experiments in this section,\\nour diffusion models operate in this Z-space. After sam-\\npling a new latent from our diffusion model, we decode it\\nto pixels using the V AE decoder x=D(z). We retain diffu-\\nsion hyperparameters from ADM [9]; speci\ufb01cally, we use a\\ntmax= 1000 linear variance schedule ranging from 1\\u000210\\u00004\\nto2\\u000210\\u00002, ADM\u2019s parameterization of the covariance \\u0006\\u0012\\nand their method for embedding input timesteps and labels.\\nEvaluation metrics. We measure scaling performance\\nwith Fr \u00b4echet Inception Distance (FID) [18], the standard\\nmetric for evaluating generative models of images.We follow convention when comparing against prior works\\nand report FID-50K using 250 DDPM sampling steps.\\nFID is known to be sensitive to small implementation de-\\ntails [37]; to ensure accurate comparisons, all values re-\\nported in this paper are obtained by exporting samples and\\nusing ADM\u2019s TensorFlow evaluation suite [9]. FID num-\\nbers reported in this section do notuse classi\ufb01er-free guid-\\nance except where otherwise stated. We additionally report\\nInception Score [51], sFID [34] and Precision/Recall [32]\\nas secondary metrics.\\nCompute. We implement all models in JAX [1] and train\\nthem using TPU-v3 pods. DiT-XL/2, our most compute-\\nintensive model, trains at roughly 5.7 iterations/second on a\\nTPU v3-256 pod with a global batch size of 256.\\n5. Experiments\\nDiT block design. We train four of our highest G\ufb02op\\nDiT-XL/2 models, each using a different block design\u2014\\nin-context (119.4 G\ufb02ops), cross-attention (137.6 G\ufb02ops),\\nadaptive layer norm (adaLN, 118.6 G\ufb02ops) or adaLN-zero\\n(118.6 G\ufb02ops). We measure FID over the course of training.\\nFigure 5 shows the results. The adaLN-Zero block yields\\nlower FID than both cross-attention and in-context condi-\\ntioning while being the most compute-ef\ufb01cient. At 400K\\ntraining iterations, the FID achieved with the adaLN-Zero\\nmodel is nearly half that of the in-context model, demon-\\nstrating that the conditioning mechanism critically affects\\nmodel quality. Initialization is also important\u2014adaLN-\\nZero, which initializes each DiT block as the identity func-\\ntion, signi\ufb01cantly outperforms vanilla adaLN. For the rest\\nof the paper, all models will use adaLN-Zero DiT blocks.\\n6\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01GmAHyVfNEzsYFTU4FBryL7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now I need to find the parameter counts.

First, as shown in Figure 2, using classifier-free guidance\\ncan significantly enhance the visual quality across all model sizes. Moreover, Figure 3a illustrates\\nthat the model achieves optimal FID at CFG = 2.0 and further increasing CFG would deteriorate FID,\\nwhich is consistent with previous findings [Dhariwal & Nichol 2021]. Additionally, the increment in\\nCFG results in a trade-off between diversity and fidelity, as evidenced by increased precision and\\ndecreased recall, demonstrated in Table 10.\\nEffect of top-k sampling. As shown in Figure 3b, a small top-k value is not beneficial for FID\\nand IS. Increasing top-k continuously improves FID but decreases IS, which trades off fidelity for\\ndiversity. We observe a similar trend when changing the parameter of top-p and temperature in\\nsampling. Since FID is our main metric, we use maximum value as the default top-k value, which is\\nthe whole codebook size.\\nComparisons with other image generation methods. In Table 6, we compare with popular image\\ngeneration models, including GAN [Brock et al. 2018; Kang et al. 2023; Sauer et al. 2022], Diffusion\\nmodels [Dhariwal & Nichol 2021; Ho et al. 2022b; Rombach et al. 2022; Peebles & Xie 2023],\\nand masked-prediction models [Chang et al. 2022]. Our models exhibit competitive performance\\nin all metrics of FID, IS, Precision and Recall. Notably, our 3B model outperforms the popular\\ndiffusion models LDM [Rombach et al. 2022], DiT [Peebles & Xie 2023]. This shows that vanilla\\nautoregressive models can serve as the basis of advanced image generation systems.\\nWhen comparing with autoregressive models [Esser et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2022], our\\nmodel outperforms all previous models at different levels of model parameters. This benefits from\\nbetter designs of image tokenizers and better scalability of image generation models. We hope our\\nsimple and effective implementation will serve as a solid baseline and help facilitate future research\\nin autoregressive models for image generations.\\n8\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01PDvfcvkt8AUDrU7YveXp6G"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect!
