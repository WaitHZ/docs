## Instruction

I am conducting research on papers for an AI Conference. For each paper, please help me find the full name of the first author, the complete institutional affiliation of the first author exactly as it appears in the paper (including all institutions if multiple are listed, and specifying down to the department level when provided), and the link to the first author’s Google Scholar profile. You need to fill them in the corresponding excel sheet under my workspace.

Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D\nregularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to\nadhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through\ncoupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that\nconcurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution\nand a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the\nmulti-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the\neffectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view\nimage editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model\narchitectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for\nmulti-view consistent editing.",

      "abstract": "We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view\nconsistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These\nmodels can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of\nmulti-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency\nacross views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D\nregularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to\nadhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through\ncoupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that\nconcurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution\nand a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the\nmulti-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the\neffectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view\nimage editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model\narchitectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for\nmulti-view consistent editing.",

      "abstract": "The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising\ncontender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and\ntraining paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread\nexploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs\napart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for\nscalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable\ncomponents that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and\nmodels are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.",

Given recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities\nrequired for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and\ninstruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start\ndataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at\nthe intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.",

Strategy Coopetition Explains the Emergence
and Transience of In-Context Learning
Aaditya K. Singh1Ted Moskovitz2Sara Dragutinovi ´c3Felix Hill4Stephanie C. Y. Chan* 4
Andrew M. Saxe* 1
Abstract
In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful ability that
emerges in transformer models, enabling them
to learn from context without weight updates.
Recent work has established emergent ICL as a
transient phenomenon that can sometimes dis-
appear after long training times. In this work,
we sought a mechanistic understanding of these
transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that—after
the disappearance of ICL—the asymptotic strat-
egy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights
and in-context learning, which we term “context-
constrained in-weights learning” (CIWL). CIWL
is in competition with ICL, and eventually re-
places it as the dominant strategy of the model
(thus leading to ICL transience). However, we
also find that the two competing strategies actu-
allyshare sub-circuits, which gives rise to coop-
erative dynamics as well. For example, in our
setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own,
and can only be enabled through the simultaneous
slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL
thus both cooperates andcompetes with ICL, a
phenomenon we term “strategy coopetition”. We
propose a minimal mathematical model that re-
produces these key dynamics and interactions. In-
formed by this model, we were able to identify a
setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.
1. Introduction
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) show an
impressive propensity for in-context learning (ICL)—the
ability to use inputs at inference time to adapt behavior
and solve tasks not seen in training. ICL contrasts with in-
weights learning (IWL), which is standard learning through

also because it emerges without being explicitly trained
for (as Brown et al. (2020) first observed, when training
transformer models on internet-scale language corpora.).
Newer work has shown that ICL can sometimes in fact
disappear after emerging, i.e. it can be transient over the
course of training (Singh et al., 2023; Anand et al., 2024;
He et al., 2024).
This evolving picture of ICL necessitates a deeper under-
standing of the dynamics of ICL emergence (and transience).
ICL is often viewed to be in competition with other strate-
gies (Nguyen & Reddy, 2024; Park et al., 2024), such as
IWL, with the tradeoff thought to be modulated by data
properties (Chan et al., 2022; 2024), model size (Wei et al.,
2023), and/or training time (Singh et al., 2023). While com-
petition may explain why ICL gives way to other strategies
through the course of training, the question remains: why
does it emerge in the first place (if only to fade away)?
In this work, we aim to extend the mechanistic understand-
ing of ICL, which currently focuses on induction heads
(Olsson et al., 2022) and their emergence dynamics (Singh
et al., 2024), to a richer dynamical setting involving multiple
strategies cycling in and out over the course of learning. To
do so, we reproduce and investigate the key transience result
in a simplified synthetic data setting with a 2-layer attention-
only transformer. Using behavioral evaluators, we find the
asymptotic strategy after the disappearance of ICL is not
pure in-weights learning. Rather, it is a surprising hybrid
strategy that we term context-constrained in-weights learn-
ing (CIWL, Section 4). The implementation of CIWL takes
the form of skip-trigrams (Elhage et al., 2021) distributed
across multiple heads in a form of superposition (Elhage
et al., 2022). Perhaps even more remarkably, we find that
even though CIWL dominates over ICL asymptotically, both
strategies share critical sub-circuits (Section 5.1), indicating
cooperative dynamics between these seemingly competitive
mechanisms—a phenomenon we term “strategy coopeti-
tion.” We borrow the term “coopetition” from game theory,
where it describes situations where competitors simultane-
ously cooperate and compete with each other.1Cooperation

Figure 1. (a)Example sequences seen during training and evaluation. Training data is “bursty”, enabling both in-context and in-weights
strategies (the context always contains an exemplar from the same class as the query, but also exemplar-label mappings are fixed throughout
training). Evaluation sequences (below dotted line) are designed to measure the presence of different strategies. ICL relies on the
exemplar-label mapping in context. IWL depends solely on in-weights information. CIWL requires the correct label in context, but not the
query exemplar. The Flip evaluator measures the balance between ICL and CIWL (1.0 means pure ICL, 0.0 means pure CIWL). Bolding
indicates OOD exemplar-label pairings. Grayed outputs indicate random selection between the two in-context labels. (b)Accuracy on
sequences from (a), over the course of training. “In-context accuracy” is computed by restricting the network’s outputs to the two labels
present in context—this ensures the same chance level (0.5) for all plotted evaluators. ICL transience is clearly visible in blue. IWL is not
shown, as we found little-to-no IWL in the networks (Appendix C.1). We annotate four points: 1. the formation of Layer 2 circuits, the
canonical “induction head”; 2. ICL strategy dominates network output, as evidenced by peak in the Flip evaluator (red); 3. CIWL strategy
matches strength of ICL, as indicated by 50% performance on Flip evaluator; 4. CIWL strategy dominates network output, leading Flip
evaluator (red) to be 0 and CIWL evaluator (green) to be 1. (c)Illustration of competitive (Layer 1) and cooperative (Layer 2) interactions
we find between ICL and CIWL strategies. Both strategies are present in varying amounts through training, as represented by the varying
line weights in the Layer 1 circuits: when Layer 1 acts as previous token heads, the network exhibits ICL, but when Layer 1 heads attend
to self, the network exhibits CIWL. Crucially, the computation in Layer 2 remains largely unchanged after its initial formation, despite the
strategy switch from ICL to CIWL.
enables the emergence of ICL (despite it not being asymp-
totically preferred), while competition leads to its eventual
transience (as previously indicated by Singh et al. (2023)).
Notably, ICL emergence can only occur when CIWL is not
fully formed (Section 5.4), which may explain the tradeoff
seen by Chan et al. (2022): under certain data properties,
CIWL forms too “quickly,” preventing ICL emergence.
We formalize our intuitions from this case study into a min-
imal mathematical model capturing coopetition dynamics
and explaining the transience behavior. Our model moti-
vates further experiments to modulate the tradeoff between
strategies through learning, like reducing the asymptotic
bias towards one strategy via data properties. For the case
of ICL vs CIWL, we find that matching context and query
exemplars removes the asymptotic bias towards CIWL and
leads to the persistence of the “faster” ICL strategy.
Our work represents a step forward in understanding how
different strategies trade off during learning, through mech-
anistic investigations on the transience of ICL. We hope our
work inspires further work on such coopetitive, dynamical
phenomena and enhances intuitions around how capabilities
emerge (and possibly fade) when training transformers.
20th century, who competed aggressively for talent and audiences,
but also collaborated to establish industry-wide standards and
jointly negotiate with labor unions.2. Experimental setup
2.1. Training details
We train 2-layer attention-only transformers (Vaswani et al.,
2017; Elhage et al., 2021) on a synthetic few-shot learn-
ing task. We use dmodel = 64 , with 8heads per layer and
learned absolute positional embeddings. As is common in
mechanistic work (Olsson et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2024),
we chose this minimal setting as it sufficed to reproduce
key phenomena.2We used the Adam optimizer (Kingma
& Ba, 2015) with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.999, a learning rate of
10−5, and a batch size of 32 sequences. All models were
trained in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018). All code is open-
sourced at https://github .com/aadityasingh/
icl-dynamics .
2.2. Dataset
Our few-shot learning task consists of sequences of
exemplar-label pairs, where image exemplars are drawn
from the Omniglot dataset of handwritten characters (Lake
et al., 2015). Each character class contains 20 image exem-
plars, and is assigned to a different one-hot label. Images
were embedded using a Resnet18 encoder that was pre-
trained on ImageNet (He et al., 2015; Russakovsky et al.,

those with MLPs or RoPE (Su et al., 2021), in Appendix B.

Abstract
Model immunization aims to pre-train models
that are difficult to fine-tune on harmful tasks
while retaining their utility on other non-harmful
tasks. Though prior work has shown empirical ev-
idence for immunizing text-to-image models, the
key understanding of when immunization is pos-
sible and a precise definition of an immunized
model remain unclear. In this work, we pro-
pose a framework, based on the condition num-
ber of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model im-
munization for linear models. Building on this
framework, we design an algorithm with regular-
ization terms to control the resulting condition
numbers after pre-training. Empirical results on
linear models and non-linear deep-nets demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
on model immunization. The code is available
athttps://github.com/amberyzheng/

1. Introduction
Model immunization, recently proposed by Zheng & Yeh
(2024), studies how to pre-train a model that is more difficult
to fine-tune on harmful content, but not others. The aim
is to mitigate the risk of misuse (Brundage et al., 2018;
Marchal et al., 2024) associated with open-sourced models
by immunizing them before they are released to the public.
Zheng & Yeh (2024) focus on immunizing text-to-image
models, where they formulate immunization as a bi-level op-
timization. Empirically, they show that pre-trained diffusion
models that undergo immunization are more difficult to fine-
tune on a given harmful concept dataset. To quantify this
difficulty, they compare the generation quality of models
with and without immunization after a fixed number of fine-
tuning iterations. While the empirical results are promising,

by the author(s).a definition of an immunized model and the circumstances
that make immunization possible remain unclear.
To tackle this issue, we propose a framework to study
model immunization using the condition number (Gloub
& Van Loan, 1996). The effectiveness of immunization can
be characterized by the condition number of the Hessian
matrix. When using gradient-based methods during fine-
tuning, a condition number closer to one indicates faster
convergence (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004), i.e., easier to
fine-tune. With this perspective, we observe that the ex-
istence of an effective immunization for linear models is
related to the angle between the singular vectors of the
harmful fine-tuning dataset’s covariance matrix and the pre-
training dataset’s covariance matrix.
From this condition number perspective, we propose an
immunization algorithm to find such a model. In detail,
we propose two additional terms to regularize the condi-
tion number during pre-training. Each of the introduced
regularization terms can be shown to ensure a monotonic
increase/decrease of the condition number under gradient
updates.
Beyond the theoretical results, we empirically validate the
proposed algorithm on linear models for regression and
image classification tasks. Lastly, we conduct experiments
using the proposed algorithm on non-linear models, i.e.,
deep-nets. Despite the gap in theory, we observe that the
proposed approach remains effective at model immunization
across ResNet (He et al., 2016) and ViT (Dosovitskiy, 2021).
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
•We introduce a framework based on the condition number
to study the task of model immunization. This framework
leads to a concrete definition of an immunized model
along with a novel experiment setup and evaluation met-
ric to compare the quality of different immunization tech-
niques.
•We propose regularizers to maximize/minimize the con-
dition number, with a guaranteed monotonic increase/de-
crease when updated with the gradient-based method.
•Together with the task objective and regularizers, we
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively im-
munizes linear models and deep-nets on regression/image
classification tasks.

Model Immunization from a Condition Number Perspective
2. Preliminaries
This section provides the background of the condition num-
ber and its connection to gradient descent. Additionally, we
briefly review transfer learning (Zhuang et al., 2020), as it
can be a technique for misusing open-source models.
Condition number and convergence of gradient descent.
Given a general matrix S, the condition number (Gloub &
Van Loan, 1996) is defined as
κ(S)≜∥S∥2S†
2=σmax
S/σmin
S, (1)
where †is the pseudoinverse and σScorresponds to the
max/min singular value of S. The condition number is
related to the convergence rate of gradient-based algorithms.
Consider an optimization problem minwL(w)where L
is strongly convex and has a Hessian ∇2Lwith max/min
singular values denoted as σmax/min. In this case, the con-
stant step-size steepest descent algorithm has a convergence
rate (Bubeck, 2015) of the following
∥wt−w∗∥2≤
1−σmin
σmaxt
∥w0−w∗∥2, (2)
where w∗denotes the optimal solution, and wtdenotes the
steepest descent iterate at step t. We can observe that a larger
condition number corresponds to a slower convergence.
Condition number regularization. Nenov et al. (2024)
proposed a regularizer for minimizing the condition number
of some general matrix S
Rwell(S) =1
2∥S∥2
2−1
2p∥S∥2
F, (3)
in which pis the minimum dimension of S, and the norms
correspond to the spectral norm and Frobenius norm. They
showed that Rwell(S)is a valid regularizer by proving its
nonnegativity, and is an upper bound on log (κ(S)). In
addition, they showed that Rwell(S)is differentiable under
some mild conditions, and if updated with gradient descent,
it is guaranteed to decrease the condition number monotoni-
cally. See Appendix A for the exact statements.
Different from Nenov et al. (2024), we propose a differen-
tiable regularizer that is guaranteed to increase the condi-
tion number as an upper bound on 1/log (κ(S)). For model
immunization, instead of a general matrix S, we need to
consider the regularization of the Hessian of linear models
composed of a feature extractor and a classifier, while pre-
serving their differentiability and monotonicity guarantees
during gradient updates to the feature extractor.
Transfer learning via linear probing. In this work, we
focus on the transfer learning method of linear probing.
Given a pre-trained feature extractor fθ:RDin→RDhid,
linear probing learns an a linear classifier hw:RDhid→RDoutover the target dataset D={(x,y)}using the frozen
feature extractor fθ. This model learning is formulated as
the following optimization problem
min
wL(D,w, θ)≜min
wX
(x,y)∈Dℓ(hw◦fθ(x),y) (4)
where ℓdenotes a suitable loss function, e.g., cross-entropy.
By keeping θfixed, the model leverages features learned
from pre-training task and transfers them to the target task.
This approach is effective when the target dataset is too
small to train a model from scratch.
3. Immunization with Condition Number
The goal of model immunization is to learn a pre-trained
model gω◦fθI, consisting of a classifier gωand an immu-
nized feature extractor fθI, such that fine-tuning fθIon a
harmful task is difficult, but not for other tasks. The model
should also maintain a good pre-training task performance.
Specifically, we study the setting when a bad actor uses
linear probing on a pre-trained linear feature extractor with
gradient descent.
Immunization setting. We denote a pre-training dataset
asDP={(x,y)}and a harmful dataset as DH={(x,˜y)}
where x∈RDin. The bad actor performs linear probing us-
ingDHfollowing Eq. (4)with an ℓ2loss. We will focus our
analysis on linear pre-trained feature extractor without di-
mensionality reduction, i.e.,fθ≜x⊤θwithθ∈RDin×Din.
Definition 3.1. Under this setting, a model is said to be
immunized if it satisfies the following:
(a)It is more difficult to apply linear probing on the harmful
taskDHusing the immunized feature extractor fθIthan
directly on the input data, i.e.,
κ(∇2
wL(DH,w, θI))≫κ(∇2
wL(DH,w,I)), (5)
where Idenotes the identity matrix.
(b)It is not more difficult to apply linear probing on other
tasks. As there is only one other task DP, an immunized
feature extractor should have
κ(∇2
ωL(DP, ω, θI))≤κ(∇2
ωL(DP, ω,I)). (6)
Note: we use ωto denote the classifier parameters of the
pre-training task and wfor the harmful task.
(c)The immunized model should maintain a competitive
task performance on the pre-training dataset DP,i.e.,
min
ω,θL(DP, ω, θ)≈min
ωL(DP, ω, θI). (7)
For linear models, as long as θIis invertible, exact equality
can be achieved.

arXiv:2506.07534v1  [cs.LG]  9 Jun 2025Flowing Datasets with Wasserstein over Wasserstein Gradient Flows
Cl´ement Bonet* 1Christophe Vauthier* 2Anna Korba1
Abstract
Many applications in machine learning involve
data represented as probability distributions. The
emergence of such data requires radically novel
techniques to design tractable gradient flows on
probability distributions over this type of (infinite-
dimensional) objects. For instance, being able to
flow labeled datasets is a core task for applica-
tions ranging from domain adaptation to transfer
learning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we
propose to represent each class by the associated
conditional distribution of features, and to model
the dataset as a mixture distribution supported on
these classes (which are themselves probability
distributions), meaning that labeled datasets can
be seen as probability distributions over proba-
bility distributions. We endow this space with a
metric structure from optimal transport, namely
the Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance,
derive a differential structure on this space, and
define WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to
design dynamics over this space that decrease a
given objective functional. We apply our frame-
work to transfer learning and dataset distillation
tasks, leveraging our gradient flow construction
as well as novel tractable functionals that take
the form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with
Sliced-Wasserstein based kernels between proba-
bility distributions.
1. Introduction
Probability measures provide a powerful way to represent
many data types. For instance, they allow to naturally repre-
sent documents (Kusner et al., 2015), genes (Bellazzi et al.,
2021), point clouds (Qi et al., 2017; Geuter et al., 2025),
images (Sodini et al., 2025), or single-cell data (Persad et al.,

by the author(s).2023; Haviv et al., 2024b). Remarkably, it has been shown
that one can embed any finite dataset with little or no distor-
tion (Andoni et al., 2018; Kratsios et al., 2023) in the Wasser-
stein space, i.e., the space of probability distributions ( e.g.,
over a Euclidean space) equipped with the Wasserstein-2 dis-
tance from Optimal Transport (OT). This has motivated the
use of this space to embed many types of data ranging from
words (Vilnis & McCallum, 2015) to knowledge graphs
(He et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2022), graphs (Bojchevski &
G¨unnemann, 2018; Petric Maretic et al., 2019), or neuro-
science data (Bonet et al., 2023). Therefore, it is essential to
develop tools to work on the space of probability measures
over probability measures, also known as random measures.
In particular, they provide a natural way to represent labeled
datasets as mixtures (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2020).
A natural distance on this space is the Wasserstein over
Wasserstein distance (WoW) (Nguyen, 2016; Catalano
& Lavenant, 2024), also known as the Hierarchical OT
distance, which lifts the Wasserstein distance between prob-
ability distributions as a ground cost, to define a Wasserstein
distance between random measures. The latter has been used
for generative modeling applications (Dukler et al., 2019),
domain adaptation tasks (El Hamri et al., 2022), comparing
documents (Yurochkin et al., 2019) or multilevel clustering
(Ho et al., 2017). It has also been used to compare Gaussian
mixtures (Chen et al., 2018; Delon & Desolneux, 2020;
Wilson et al., 2024) or generic mixtures (Dusson et al., 2023;
Chen & Zhang, 2024). However, its poor sample complexity
has motivated the development of alternative distance mea-
sures, such as those based on Integral Probability Metrics
(Catalano & Lavenant, 2024). Nonetheless, this space pos-
sesses a rich Riemannian structure, enabling the definition
of concepts like geodesics. This has been leveraged recently
by Haviv et al. (2024a) to perform generative modeling over
the space of probability distributions with Flow Matchings.
While this space naturally supports a range of machine learn-
ing tasks, optimization methods tailored to it have received
limited attention. Yet, this is important for multiple ap-
plications, including variational inference with a Gaussian
mixture family (Lambert et al., 2022; Huix et al., 2024),
computing barycenters (Delon & Desolneux, 2020), or flow-
ing datasets (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021), e.g., for domain
adaptation, transfer learning (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021;
Hua et al., 2023) or dataset distillation (Wang et al., 2018).

Flowing Datasets with Wasserstein over Wasserstein Gradient Flows
In this paper, we propose to leverage the Riemannian struc-
ture of random measures equipped with the WoW distance,
by defining and simulating gradient flows, i.e., paths of ran-
dom measures that follow the steepest descent of a given
objective functional.
Related works. An elegant and popular way to perform
optimization over probability distributions (over a manifold)
is to leverage the Riemannian structure of the Wasserstein
space (Otto, 2001), and to use Wasserstein gradient flows
(Ambrosio et al., 2008; Santambrogio, 2017). Several time
discretizations of these flows have been studied (Jordan
et al., 1998; Salim et al., 2020; Bonet et al., 2024), and
they have been applied to simulate the flow dynamics of
multiple objectives such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence
(Wibisono, 2018; Salim et al., 2020; Diao et al., 2023), the
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Arbel et al., 2019;
Altekr ¨uger et al., 2023; Hertrich et al., 2024a;b) and variants
thereof (Glaser et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024; Neumayer
et al., 2024; Chazal et al., 2024) or the Sliced-Wasserstein
distance (Liutkus et al., 2019; Du et al., 2023; Bonet et al.,
2025). Yet, all these works focus on the case where the prob-
ability distributions are defined over a finite-dimensional
manifold, e.g. Rd. In practice, simulating these flows
often boils down to simulating a particle system in Rd.
Hence, these works do not address probability distributions
defined on infinite-dimensional spaces, such as the space
of probability measures, which is the focus of this work.
The closest works to ours are the ones of Alvarez-Melis &
Fusi (2021) and Hua et al. (2023). These papers cast labeled
datasets as measures over a product space of the features
and the conditional distributions ( i.e., the distributions of
the features of a given class). However, they circumvent the
issue of designing gradient flows on this space by modeling
the conditional probabilities as Gaussian distributions, hence
parametrized by a mean and covariance, which are finite-
dimensional objects. While this enables them to leverage
standard Wasserstein gradient flows, this Gaussian modeling
of mixture components is a strong assumption that may not
capture the true shape of many labeled datasets in practice.
Contributions. In this work, we introduce a principled
framework for optimizing functionals over the space of
probability measures on probability measures, leveraging
the Riemannian structure of this space to develop Wasser-
stein over Wasserstein (WoW) gradient flows. We provide
a theoretical construction of the flows, and then a practical
implementation through time discretization using a forward
Euler scheme. We also propose a novel functional objective,
that writes as an MMD with kernel between distributions
based on the Sliced-Wasserstein distance, and whose gradi-
ent flow simulation is tractable. We then apply this scheme
to flow datasets viewed as random measures; specifically, asmixtures of probability distributions corresponding to the
class-conditional distributions. We focus on image datasets,
and show that the flow enables structured transitions of
classes toward other classes, with applications to transfer
learning and dataset distillation.
Notations. For a Riemannian manifold M,d:M ×
M → R+is its geodesic distance. For x∈ M , we denote
byTxMthe tangent space at x, and by ∥ · ∥xthe Rieman-
nian metric. We define by TM={(x, v), x∈ M andv∈
TxM} the tangent bundle. We define for (x, v)∈TM
the projections πM(x, v) =xandπv(x, v) =v.exp :
TM → M is the exponential map. For x∈ M , if
expx:TxM → M is invertible, we note logxits inverse.
∇anddivrefer to the Riemannian gradient and divergence

of probability distributions on Xwith second finite mo-
ments, i.e.,P2(X) ={µ∈ P(X),R

witho∈Xsome arbitrary origin. For any µ∈ P 2(M),
L2(µ, TM)is the set of functions v:M → TM
such thatR

2. Background
We begin by introducing some background on Optimal
Transport (OT) and on Wasserstein Gradient Flows. For the-
oretical purposes, we provide background on the geometry
of (P2(M),W2)withMa Riemannian manifold, as in the
next section, we will rely on results which hold on compact
Riemannian manifolds (without boundary). Nonetheless,
the applications will be done for M=Rd. The reader may
refer to Appendix A for more details.

µ, ν∈ P2(M)is defined as

The metric space (P2(M),W2)has a Riemannian
structure (Otto, 2001; Erbar, 2010). In particular, if
the log map is well defined µ-almost everywhere (a.e.),

Abstract
The expected signature maps a collection of data
streams to a lower dimensional representation,
with a remarkable property: the resulting fea-
ture tensor can fully characterize the data gener-
ating distribution. This “model-free” embedding
has been successfully leveraged to build multi-
ple domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) al-
gorithms for time series and sequential data. The
convergence results proved in this paper bridge
the gap between the expected signature’s em-
pirical discrete-time estimator and its theoreti-
cal continuous-time value, allowing for a more
complete probabilistic interpretation of expected
signature-based ML methods. Moreover, when
the data generating process is a martingale, we
suggest a simple modification of the expected sig-
nature estimator with significantly lower mean
squared error and empirically demonstrate how it
can be effectively applied to improve predictive
performance.
1. Introduction
The signature transform of a stream of data is an infinite but
countable sequence of its “iterated integrals” summarizing
the input in a top-down fashion, meaning the informational
content of its terms decays factorially. Originally introduced
by Chen (1954) and serving as a fundamental object of
rough path analysis (Lyons et al., 2007), the signature
S={S(X)[0,t]∈T((Rd)), t∈[0, T]},
of a path X={Xt, t∈[0, T]} ∈C([0, T],Rd)is a lift
(in the sense that it embeds X) to the space of continuous
functions over the tensor algebra T((Rd))possessing some
nice algebraic and geometric properties. When the path is of
bounded variation, the signature is defined as the sequence

In many practical applications the path Xis taken to be
the piecewise linear interpolation of a discrete-time stream
of data, which is of bounded variation by construction.
Signature-based machine learning (ML) approaches (Lyons
& McLeod, 2024) thus often restrict the theoretical frame-
work to paths in BV([0, T],Rd). In this setting, two funda-
mental properties of the signature that make it a desirable
non-parametric feature extraction method for sequential
data are the characterization result of Hambly & Lyons
(2005) and the universality approximation theorem of Levin
et al. (2016). Moreover, when the path Xis understood
as a (realization of a) random process with distribution P
over BV([0, T],Rd), the shuffle property of the signature
implies that all moments of the random variable S(X)[0,T]
are determined by its expectation
ϕ(T) :=E[S(X)[0,T]]∈T((Rd)).
A natural question, known as the Hamburger moment prob-
lem (Fawcett, 2003), is thus whether the expectation of
the signature characterizes its law (and thus the law of the
path). When imposing a probability distribution PonX
the assumption of bounded variation paths becomes quite
restrictive: Brownian motion, the basic building block of
many stochastic models, has paths of infinite variation al-
most surely. Even if we observe a discrete-time stream of
data, we often still would like to define the process Xas
a latent stochastic process of which we observe the linear
interpolation over some partition πof[0, T], hereafter de-
noted by Xπ. We hence wish to make sense of the signature
of a stochastic process Xwith paths of unbounded variation.
For a given path X∈C([0, T],Rd)of finite p-variation,
once we “lift” the process to a p-rough path (Lyons et al.,
2007, Definition 3.11) then the signature SofXis uniquely
defined1. Without delving into the details of rough path
theory, for our purposes it suffices to interpret the choice of
lift as fixing a notion of integration with respect to X: the
higher order signatures terms are then understood as iterated
integrals of the path Xdefined in this sense.
1This is the first fundamental theorem in the theory of rough
paths (Lyons et al., 2007, Theorem 3.7).

Learning with Expected Signatures: Theory and Applications
Motivated by the fact that we can only ever observe the
process Xover a discrete partition πof[0, T]we restrict our
attention to the class of stochastic processes whose lift (and
hence signature) can be approximated by the lift (and hence
signature) of the bounded variation path Xπ. Following the
rough path literature we take such approximation in the p-
variation metric to define the notion of canonical geometric
stochastic process , cf. Definition 2.1. In Chevyrev & Lyons
(2016); Chevyrev & Oberhauser (2018) the authors provide
characterization results for the expected signature of canon-
ical geometric stochastic processes, i.e. conditions under
which the map P7→E[S(X)[0,T]]is injective. Such charac-
terizing property of the expected signature has found practi-
cal use in a wide range of applications, ranging from classic
ML tasks (Lemercier et al., 2021; Triggiano & Romito,
2024; Schell & Oberhauser, 2023) to mathematical finance
(Lyons et al., 2021; Futter et al., 2023).
The expected signature is thus a highly informative quan-
tity and, consequently, methods for computing ϕ(T)have
received considerable research interest. Such methods can
be broadly categorized into two classes: those employing an
analytical approach and those following a statistical one. An-
alytical methods aim to develop exact formulas for specific
classes of models. A first step in this direction was taken
in Ni (2012, Section 4) showing that the expected signature
of an It ˆo diffusion satisfies an explicit partial differential
equation (PDE). This result was subsequently generalized
in Cuchiero et al. (2023) to the class of signature-SDEs and
in Friz et al. (2022; 2024) to (discontinuous) semimartin-
gales. On the other hand, the statistical approach aims to
estimate ϕ(T)directly from observed data, preserving the
model-free nature of the expected signature. For a given set
of observations X1,π, . . . ,XN,πone can form the estimator
ˆϕN,π(T) :=1
NNX
n=1S(Xn,π)[0,T],
as illustrated in Figure 1, and study its in-fill |π| →0and
large-sample N→ ∞ asymptotics. This line of work in-
cludes the explicit results of Ni (2012, Section 3.2) for
Brownian motion and of Passeggeri (2020) for fractional
Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H > 1/2as well
as the preliminary results in Friz & Victoir (2010) for more
general semimartingales. Additionally, Schell & Oberhauser
(2023, Section 8) develops asymptotic results for processes
of bounded variation. In this work we provide a unifying set
of general conditions under which the expected signature
estimator ˆϕN,π(T)displays important asymptotic statistical
properties, namely consistency and asymptotic normality.
Our results allow for irregular2observation partitions π
– possibly varying across samples – and for dependency
2Clearly, for the estimation problem to be well-posed, the se-
quence of partitions needs to be signature defining in the sense of
Definition 2.5.across the samples X1,π, . . . ,Xn,π. The first main contri-
bution of this paper is thus to bridge the gap between the
empirical expected signature estimator and the expected
signature of a latent continuous-time stochastic process, un-
locking a more general probabilistic interpretation of several
ML algorithms and effectively moving beyond the expected
signature as a simple feature extraction method. This natu-
rally leads to the second theoretical contribution: by starting
from the continuous-time setting we devise a modification
of the expected signature estimator with significantly bet-
ter finite sample properties when the latent data generating
process is a martingale. The superior performance of this
modified estimator is empirically verified through various
experiments with expected signature-based ML algorithms
from the literature.

2. Theory
LetX={Xt, t∈[0, T]}denote a d-dimensional stochas-
tic process over the probability space (Ω,F,P).
Definition 2.1. We say Xis a canonical geometric stochastic
process of rough order pif there exists a sequence of parti-
tions ρwith|ρ| →0such that the limit in the p-variation
metric of the canonically lifted linearly interpolated process
Xρexists in probability. Convergence in probability implies
almost sure convergence (along a subsequence) and hence
we can almost surely define the lift of Xas such limit.
Remark 2.2.The definition of lift suggests this might de-
pend on the choice of the sequence of partitions ρ. In any
case, for a wide range of stochastic processes there exist
canonical lifts that satisfy our definition of canonical geo-
metric rough path. These include:
•Semimartingales: For p∈(2,3)any semimartingale
can be lifted to a geometric p-rough path by defining
the lift via Stratonovich integration; the signature of
Xthen coincides with iterated Stratonovich integrals.
For any sequence of partitions ρthe lifts of the linear

arXiv:2410.02958v2  [cs.LG]  6 Jun 2025AutoML-Agent: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Full-Pipeline AutoML
Patara Trirat1Wonyong Jeong1Sung Ju Hwang1 2
Abstract
Automated machine learning (AutoML) acceler-
ates AI development by automating tasks in the
development pipeline, such as optimal model
search and hyperparameter tuning. Existing Au-
toML systems often require technical expertise
to set up complex tools, which is in general time-
consuming and requires a large amount of human
effort. Therefore, recent works have started ex-
ploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen
such burden and increase the usability of AutoML
frameworks via a natural language interface, al-
lowing non-expert users to build their data-driven
solutions. These methods, however, are usually
designed only for a particular process in the AI
development pipeline and do not efficiently use
the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper pro-
poses AutoML-Agent , a novel multi-agent frame-
work tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from
data retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-
Agent takes user’s task descriptions, facilitates
collaboration between specialized LLM agents,
and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike ex-
isting work, instead of devising a single plan, we
introduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy
to enhance exploration to search for more optimal
plans. We also decompose each plan into sub-
tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network
design) each of which is solved by a specialized
agent we build via prompting executing in parallel,
making the search process more efficient. More-
over, we propose a multi-stage verification to ver-
ify executed results and guide the code generation
LLM in implementing successful solutions. Ex-
tensive experiments on seven downstream tasks
using fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent
achieves a higher success rate in automating the
full AutoML process, yielding systems with good
performance throughout the diverse domains.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) has significantly
reduced the need for technical expertise and human labors
in developing effective data-driven solutions by automating
each process in the AI development pipeline (Yao et al.,
2018; Ren et al., 2020; He et al., 2021), such as feature
engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimiza-
tion (HPO). However, current AutoML systems (Gijsbers
et al., 2024) often necessitate programming expertise to
configure complex tools and resources, potentially creating
barriers for a larger pool of users with limited skills and
knowledge, such as domain experts (Sun et al. (2023); §A).
To make AutoML frameworks more accessible to non-expert
users, many recent studies (Trirat et al., 2021; Viswanathan
et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Hollmann et al., 2023b; Liu
et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhang
et al., 2024a; Hong et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2024a; Yang
et al., 2025; Chi et al., 2024) have suggested to use natural
language interfaces with large language models (LLM) for
machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) tasks. Nev-
ertheless, these previous LLM-based AutoML frameworks
only considered a limited number of tasks due to their re-
stricted designs, either only for a process in the pipeline (e.g.,
feature engineering (Hollmann et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024;
Malberg et al., 2024), HPO (Liu et al., 2024a; 2025; Zhang
et al., 2024a), and model selection (Zhang et al., 2023; Shen
et al., 2023)) or for a specific group of downstream tasks
(e.g., natural language processing (Viswanathan et al., 2023)
and computer vision (Yang et al., 2025)). In addition, most
methods overlook the inherent capability of LLMs to search
for promising models by performing actual training of the
candidate models during the search process, making it pro-
hibitively costly and slow.
For an AutoML framework to be truly practical, it should
perform end-to-end AutoML, considering both the data
aspects (retrieval, preprocessing, and feature engineering)
andmodel aspects (selection, HPO, and deployment). This
is because a process in one aspect can affect subsequent
processes in the other, potentially leading to suboptimal so-
lutions when combining results from different frameworks.
Meanwhile, the AutoML framework should be computation-
ally efficient, using strategies to minimize the computational
overhead during search. However, there are two main chal-
lenges in building such a framework.

AutoML-Agent: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Full-Pipeline AutoML
High Complexity of Planning Tasks The planning of the
entire AutoML pipeline introduces extra complexities com-
pared to task- or problem-specific planning, primarily due to
the inter-dependencies among the steps in the pipeline. For
example, types of retrieved datasets affects how to design
preprocessing steps and neural networks. Then, the designed
network affects which particular hyper-parameters need to
be optimized depending on the given downstream task. Such
inter-step dependencies result in the enlarged search space
since it should consider all possible combinations of inter-
related steps. Besides, enabling the framework to operate
across various downstream tasks exacerbates these chal-
lenges, as each has task-specific requirements.
Challenges in Accurate Implementations To develop a
modular and extendable framework that effectively handles
diverse ML tasks, it is crucial to enhance the flexibility of
the LLM agent in its code generation ability, such as by
decoupling the template code from the code for specific
datasets. However, using LLMs to autonomously gener-
ate complete ML pipelines may lead to hallucination issues,
including code incompletion, incorrect or missing dependen-
cies, and potential undiscovered bugs (Hong et al., 2024b).
Furthermore, LLMs often struggle with code generation
when prompted with ambiguous task descriptions. Thus,
we need accurate analysis of the requirements, and a code-
generation platform that can adaptively generate code based
on disambiguated requirements.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework, AutoML-Agent , for full-pipeline AutoML from
data and model search to evaluation, with strategies to tackle
the complexity of the planning problem as well as accu-
rate implementation of code. As illustrated in Figure 1,
AutoML-Agent accepts a user’s task description and coordi-
nates multiple specialized agents to collaboratively identify
an optimal ML pipeline, ultimately delivering a deployment-
ready model and its inference endpoint as the output.
Specifically, to tackle the complex planning problem, we
introduce a new retrieval-augmented planning strategy
equipped with role-specific decomposition and prompting-
based execution. This strategy produces multiple plans
based on retrieved knowledge for a given task description,
facilitating the exploration of promising plans. Moreover, it
enables LLM agents to discern global (pipeline-level) and
local (process-level) relationships among steps through plan
decomposition, which helps them focus on their immediate
sub-tasks while aligning with the user’s goal. The retrieval-
augmented component also simplifies extending LLMs to
various downstream tasks using relevant knowledge. The
prompting-based execution enhances search efficiency by
exploiting LLMs’ in-context learning capabilities without
any further training, which could introduce additional cost.
To enhance the accuracy of the implementation, we adopt
structure-based prompt parsing that extracts ML-relevant

verification that provides feedback between each step in
the framework to ensure the quality of instructions when
guiding the LLM for code generation. These modules aim
to improve the correctness and clarity of the task description
for code implementation. Our contributions are as follows.
•We propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework for Au-
toML, designed to automate the entire AI development
pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first at-
tempt to employ LLMs in a task-agnostic AutoML frame-
work that spans from data retrieval to model deployment.
•We address the challenges due to the complexity of the
planning problem in full-pipeline AutoML by introduc-
ing retrieval-augmented planning with role-specific plan
decomposition and prompting-based plan execution, en-
hancing the flexibility and efficiency of the search process.
•To enhance the accuracy of our full-pipeline implemen-
tation, we integrate structure-based prompt parsing and
multi-stage verification to ensure the quality of resulting
solutions and instructions prior to actual code implemen-
tation, thereby improving overall performance.
•We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AutoML-
Agent framework through extensive experiments on seven
downstream tasks using fourteen datasets.
•We have made the source code available at https://

AutoML is a transformative approach for optimizing ML
workflows, enabling both practitioners and researchers to
efficiently design models and preprocessing pipelines with
minimal manual intervention (Ren et al., 2020; He et al.,
2021; Gijsbers et al., 2024). Despite several advancements
in AutoML (Jin et al., 2019; Feurer et al., 2022; Tang et al.,
2024), most of them are designed only for particular ele-
ments of the ML pipeline. Only a few works (Bisong, 2019;

Learning Smooth and Expressive Interatomic
Potentials for Physical Property Prediction

1Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) at Meta
Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become increasingly effective at approximating
quantum mechanical calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, lower errors
on held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property
prediction tasks. We propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during
molecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and
their performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to
models failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The
resulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks,
including materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.

1 Introduction
Density Functional Theory (DFT), which models the
electrons in materials and molecules, serves as the
foundation for many modern drug and materials dis-
covery workflows. Unfortunately, DFT calculations
are notoriously computationally intensive, scaling
cubically with the number of electrons in the sys-
tem: O(n3). Machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs) are promising in approximating and expe-
diting DFT calculations. With increasing data set
sizes and model innovations, MLIPs have shown sub-
stantial improvements in accuracy and generalization
capabilities (Batatia et al., 2023; Merchant et al.,
2023; Yang et al., 2024; Barroso-Luque et al., 2024).
Predicting physical properties in chemistry and ma-
terials science often requires complex workflows in-
volving numerous evaluations of DFT or MLIPs. For
example, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
forces are predicted over thousands to millions of
time steps. However, the MLIP literature has mostly
focused on assessing models based on energy and
force predictions over static DFT test sets rather
than directly assessing their performance in complex
simulations. This approach has limitations, as im-
proved accuracy on test sets does not always lead to
better predictions of physical properties (Póta et al.,
2024; Loew et al., 2024).In this paper, we address two questions: Why does
higher test accuracy sometimes fail to enhance a
model’s ability to predict physical properties, and
how can we improve MLIPs to excel in this area? We
first outline four critical property prediction tasks
and identify the properties required for an MLIP
to succeed in these tasks. These properties entail
learning a conservative model with continuous and
bounded energy derivatives, indicating a smoothly-
varying and physically meaningful energy landscape.
To test whether these properties hold, we propose
testing the ability of MLIPs to practically conserve
energy in MD simulations. We demonstrate models
that pass this test have a higher correlation between
test errors and property prediction accuracy.
Building on these insights, we present a novel MLIP
called eSEN and training approach that achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex
property prediction tasks. Specifically, our model
is capable of running energy-conserving MD simula-
tions for out-of-distribution systems (Figure 1 (a)).
For materials stability prediction, eSEN achieves a
leading F1 score of 0.831and a κSRMEof0.340on the
compliant Matbench-Discovery benchmark (Riebe-
sell et al., 2023; Póta et al., 2024). Previous models
are only able to excel in one of these metrics ( Fig-
ure 1 (b,c)). We also achieve a SOTA F1 score of
0.925andκSRMEof0.170on the non-compliant cate-

2024), SOTA results are found (Figure 1 (d)). Fi-
nally, eSEN achieves the highest test accuracy on the
SPICE-MACE-OFF dataset (Kovács et al., 2023).
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Machine learning interatomic potentials
Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (Op-
penheimer, 1927) utilized by DFT (Parr et al., 1979),
the Potential Energy Surface (PES) can be written
as a function of positions, r, and atomic numbers, a:
E(r,a). Per-atom forces can be calculated by taking
the negative gradient of the PES with respect to the
atom positions, F=−∇ rE. For periodic systems
such as inorganic materials, the lattice parameters l
are also considered ( E(r,a,l)), and the stress σmay
also be calculated, which can be understood as the
gradient of the potential energy surface with respect
to the lattice parameters.
The goal of an MLIP (Unke et al., 2021b) is to predictthe exact same properties as DFT from a training
dataset of DFT calculations (Chanussot et al., 2021;
Riebesell et al., 2023; Loew et al., 2024). The most
straightforward benchmark for MLIPs is to evaluate
the model on a held-out test set of DFT calculations,
andcomparemodelsbasedonthemeanabsoluteerror
(MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) of ener-
gies, forces, or stresses. To bridge the gap between
these performance metrics and practical applicabil-
ity, we need to ensure they correlate with physical
property prediction tasks, such as those described
next.
2.2 Physical property prediction tasks
Geometry optimization/relaxation. Many computa-
tional chemistry and materials science tasks rely on
atomic systems being in stable configurations, which
correspond to minima of the PES. Stable states are
found by minimizing the potential energy using an
optimization procedure that iteratively updates atom
positions based on the predicted forces ( F=−∇ rE).
Given that many physical properties are evaluated
at or near equilibrium states, geometry optimization
(also referred to as “relaxation”) is usually the first
step in most computational workflows.
MD simulations. Simulating the time evolution of
atomic systems enables us to gain understanding of
various chemical and biological processes, as well as
enabling the calculation of macroscopic properties,
such as liquid densities, that can be experimentally
verified. For the task of molecular dynamics simu-
lation, we typically use a potential to compute the
per-atom forces which are then used to numerically
integrate Newton’s equations of motion. In this work,
we will focus on the microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ,
where the number of particles (N), the volume of the
system (V), and the energy of the system (E) are
kept constant.
Phonon and thermal conductivity calculations. Precise
predictions of phonon band structures and vibra-
tional modes are essential for understanding various
material properties, including dynamical stability,
thermal stability Bartel (2022); Fultz (2010), ther-
mal conductivity Razeghi (2002), and optoelectronic
behavior Ganose et al. (2021). The calculation of
phonon band structures requires the MLIP to accu-
rately predict higher-order derivatives and capture
the subtle curvature of the true PES around critical
points. Recent work Póta et al. (2024) has demon-
strated the usage of MLIPs in predicting thermal
conductivity ( κ) by solving the Wigner transport
equation (Simoncelli et al., 2022). In order to accu-
rately predict κ, MLIPs must reliably capture both
