However, LMs often struggle to perform tasks that require complex skills (e.g., math or complex reasoning), and are fundamentally unable to solve other tasks that require access to information not included in their training data (e.g., the current weather or date).\\n\\n\\\\begin{wrapfigure}[13]{r}{0.42\\\\textwidth}\\n\\\\vspace{-4mm}    \\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.39\\\\textwidth]{./figures/definition.pdf}\\n\\\\vspace{-2mm}\\n\\\\caption{Illustration of tools extending and facilitating LM task-solving.}\\n\\\\label{fig:def}\\n\\\\end{wrapfigure}\\n\\nTo solve this problem, researchers and practitioners are turning to LMs enhanced with \\\\emph{tools}, which help \\\\textit{facilitate} the task-solving process of LMs, or \\\\textit{extend} LMs with new abilities that the LM does not possess otherwise \\\\citep{qin2023tool,mialon2023augmented}.\\nFor example, a \\\\texttt{calculator} tool may be used to facilitate mathematical calculations, or a \\\\texttt{get\\\\_time()} tool could be used to obtain the current time, which is not available purely through the LM's parameters. \\nInspired by the tools used by humans \\\\citep{shumaker2011animal}, some works introduce application-specific \\\\texttt{software} as tools, such as using a \\\\texttt{search engine} to obtain knowledge \\\\citep{lazaridou2022internetaugmented,komeili-etal-2022-internet}, using a \\\\texttt{translator} to process unknown languages \\\\citep{schick2023toolformer}, or using a \\\\texttt{SQL engine} to query databases \\\\citep{hao2023toolkengpt,zhuang2023toolqa}.\\nWith the development of numerous application programming interfaces (APIs) on the web, many works collect \\\\texttt{API}s as tools to access world data in real-time \\\\citep{balog2016deepcoder,xu2023tool,qin2023toolllm} via multiple modalities \\\\citep{tang2023toolalpaca}, even performing professional activities such as financial analysis \\\\citep{li-etal-2023-api} and digital marketing \\\\citep{huang2024metatool}.\\nInstead of using black-box APIs with unseen implementations, other works use locally-crafted \\\\texttt{function}s to query over structured tables \\\\citep{wang2024executable,cao2023api} or images \\\\citep{suris2023vipergpt}, where the function tools can be created by human \\\\citep{gupta2022visual} or model experts \\\\citep{wang2023voyager,cai2023large,wang2024trove}.\\n\\n% issue, motivation; our diff from existing surveys\\nHowever, despite this broad and burgeoning area of tool use in LMs, existing surveys only cover certain tool categories such as software \\\\citep{mialon2023augmented} or APIs \\\\citep{qin2023tool}. \\nIn this paper, we (1) provide a unified view of tool use across a broad range of scenarios, (2) empirically analyze the cost efficiency of tooling methods, to give practical guidance on when and how one should use tools, and (3) offer concrete suggestions for evaluations.\\n\\nWe start with proposing \\\\textit{a unified definition} of tools and explain \\\\textit{why tools help task-solving} (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:background}).\\nWe first introduce the \\\\emph{basic tool-use paradigm} (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:basic-paradigm}) and study a variety of tool-using scenarios by enumerating \\\\textit{which tools exist} and \\\\textit{to which tasks they apply} (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:scenarios}). \\nNext, we study advanced approaches for \\\\textit{complex tool usage} and even \\\\textit{make new tools} if they are unavailable for the task (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:methods}). \\nWe then summarize existing testbeds and evaluation metrics across LM tooling works, and highlight several missing aspects with concrete metric suggestions (\\\\S\\\\ref{sec:good-tool}).\\nLastly, grounding on our empirical analysis about \\\\textit{when tools are effective}, we identify the most efficient tooling approaches and the tasks that benefit most from tools (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:trade-off}). \\n\\n\\n\\n% ##################\\n\\\\section{Background}\\n\\\\label{sec:background}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{What are tools?}\\n% how existing works define tools\\nBecause LMs are products of the digital world, tools employed by LMs are often computer \\\\textbf{programs} that are executable in corresponding environments, e.g., Python programs are executable in Python environments. \\nReferring back to human-used tools, \\\\citet{shumaker2011animal} defines animal tool use as \\\\textit{``the external employment of an unattached or manipulable attached environmental object to alter more efficiently the form, position, or condition of another object.''}\\n% two properties of tools\\nSimilar to this definition of physical tools, LM-used program tools should also be \\\\textbf{external} to the employer (i.e., the LM) and are part of the environment. \\nIn the meantime, instead of arbitrary program snippets, a tool is a \\\\textbf{function} (e.g., \\\\texttt{plus\\\\_one}), meaning that it can be applied to other objects (e.g., data) and yield an output (e.g. \\\\texttt{plus\\\\_one}$(1) \\\\rightarrow 2$).\\n\\nExisting definitions of LM-used tools touch on some of these aspects. \\n\\\\citet{qin2023tool} make an intuitive appeal to the similarity to human tool use, but do not define what entails a tool.\\n\\\\citet{mialon2023augmented} define \\\\textit{a tool} as \\\\textit{``an external module that is typically called using a rule or a special token and whose output is included in the augmented LM's context.''}\\nWe argue for a somewhat more broad definition than this, which encompasses a wide variety of more recent works on tool usage:\\n\\n\\\\begin{definition}\\n  \\\\label{def:tools-lm}\\n  An LM-used tool is a function interface to a computer program that runs \\\\textit{externally} to the LM, where the LM generates the function calls and input arguments in order to use the tool.\\\\footnote{Under our definition, tool functions can be implemented by any means, including symbolic computation or neural networks --- the functions only require a programmatic interface.}\\n\\\\end{definition} \\n\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Why are tools helpful?}\\nTools can help task-solving in different ways, depending on the functionality of individual tools. We summarize their functions into three major categories: perception, action, and computation. A tool may belong to one or more of these three categories.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Perception} \\\\quad\\nPerception tools provide or collect information from the environment. An example is using a \\\\texttt{get\\\\_time()} API to obtain the current time, which is not included in the LM's parametric knowledge learned from training.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Action} \\\\quad\\nAction tools can exert actions on the environment and change its state. For example, \\\\texttt{turn\\\\_left()} can shift the direction of an embodied agent, or executing \\\\texttt{make\\\\_post(website, post)} can change the content on a \\\\texttt{website}.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Computation} \\\\quad\\nComputation tools do not necessarily perceive or modify the external environment, but use programs to tackle complex computational tasks. For example, a \\\\texttt{calculator} is a computation tool for mathematical calculation.\\nNote that the computation also includes more general acts of computing beyond numerical calculation. Therefore, a \\\\texttt{translator} is also a computation tool that can be used to translate between languages.\\n\\nNote that many tools can fall into multiple categories.\\nFor instance, a \\\\texttt{search engine} is a tool that can perform both computation and perception.\\nAs computation, it measures document similarity and selects relevant ones, but it also perceives the environment (i.e., the web) and fetches data (i.e., returned documents) from it.\\nIn a similar spirit, \\\\textsc{SQL} queries can be used as computation tools (e.g., \\\\texttt{SELECT SQRT(16) / 10 AS result}), perception tools for viewing data (e.g., \\\\texttt{SELECT name FROM data}), action tools to modify data (e.g., \\\\texttt{INSERT INTO data VALUES name}), or all of the above (e.g., \\\\texttt{INSERT INTO counts (grp\\\\_id, grp\\\\_cnt) SELECT grp\\\\_id, COUNT(*) FROM data GROUP BY grp\\\\_id}).\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Tools and ``Agents''} \\nThere has recently been a burgeoning of work on LM-powered agents \\\\citep{xi2023rise,sumers2024cognitive}.\\n\\\\citet{russell2010artificial} define agents as \\\\textit{``anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.''}\\nAccording to this definition, agents are programs that use perception tools to perceive the situated environment, or action tools to interact with the environment.\\nModels that only use computation tools and do not interact with their environments through perception or action tools arguably do not fall under the category of ``agents'' according to this definition.\\n\\n\\n\\n% ###################################\\n\\\\section{The basic tool use paradigm}\\n\\\\label{sec:basic-paradigm}\\n% figure start\\n\\\\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{r}{0.42\\\\textwidth}\\n\\\\vspace{-5mm}\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.40\\\\textwidth]{./figures/call-api.pdf}\\n\\\\vspace{-2mm}\\n\\\\caption{The basic tool use paradigm. LM calls \\\\raisebox{0.3mm}{\\\\colorbox{violet!13}{\\\\texttt{check\\\\_weather}}} tool by generating text tokens. This call triggers the server to execute the call and return the output \\\\raisebox{0.3mm}{\\\\colorbox{yellow!33}{sunny}}, using which the LM replaces the API call tokens in the response to the user.}\\n\\\\label{fig:call-api}\\n\\\\end{wrapfigure}\\n% figure end\\n\\nFirst, in this section, we show an illustrative example of a basic tool-use paradigm introduced by Toolformer \\\\citep{schick2023toolformer}, which many tool-related works adopt (\\\\autoref{fig:call-api}). Assuming an LM communicates with users mainly in natural language, upon receiving a user query such as ``How is the weather today?'', the LM then proceeds to generate either text or tool calls. In the example, starts with generating a few tokens of text ``It is ...''. When the LM needs to seek external tools to complete the task, e.g., get real-time weather information, it generates tokens of the tool name and corresponding input arguments enclosed with \\\\texttt{(}parentheses\\\\texttt{)} to construct a complete tool calling expression. \\nThis completed expression will trigger a shift from text-generation mode to tool-execution mode. The server hosting the tool will execute the expression and return the execution result to the LM. \\n\\nTaking the example in \\\\autoref{fig:call-api-v0}, the LM sends the \\\\texttt{check\\\\_weather()} call to the weather server and receives the output ``sunny''. The returned result replaces the tool call in the LM-generated tokens (e.g., from ``It is \\\\texttt{check\\\\_weather()}'' to ``It is sunny''), which is used for subsequent steps of generation.\\nAccordingly, the LM shifts back to the text generation mode and continues to finish the response by generating new text tokens, e.g., adding `today.', and finally returning the response to the user.\\n\\nIn order for LMs to use this basic paradigm of using tools, current works mainly leverage inference-time prompting and training-time learning methods.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Inference-time prompting} \\\\quad\\nLeveraging the ability of LMs to learn in-context \\\\citep{}, many works provide tool information through a prompt and expect LMs to acquire abilities to use these tools from input contexts.\\nThis is achieved by providing instructions about the task, example pairs of queries and solutions that use tools \\\\citep{gupta2022visual,lu2023chameleon,paranjape2023art,shen2023hugginggpt,yang2023mmreact}, and/or documentation of the tools' functionality \\\\citep{hsieh2023tool}.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Learning by training} \\\\quad\\nBeyond learning tools from test-time contexts, LMs can learn from examples that use these tools during training.\\nLMs can simply be trained to generate tool-using solutions, where the examples can be manually annotated by humans \\\\citep{li-etal-2023-api}, synthesized by larger teacher LMs \\\\citep{tang2023toolalpaca,qin2023toolllm,huang2024metatool}, or bootstrapped by the test-time LM itself \\\\citep{schick2023toolformer}.\\n\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/my_paper/sections/2_scenarios.tex:\\n\\n\\\\textbf{\\\\begin{table}[t]\\n\\\\vspace{-5mm}\\n\\\\small\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n    \\\\begin{tabular}{ll}\\n    \\\\toprule\\n    \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Category}} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Example Tools}} \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\midrule\\n    \\\\multirow{3}{*}{\\\\kn ~~Knowledge access} & {\\\\texttt{sql\\\\_executor(query:~str) -> answer:~any}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & {\\\\texttt{search\\\\_engine(query:~str) -> document:~str}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & {\\\\texttt{retriever(query:~str) -> document:~str}} \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\midrule\\n    \\\\multirow{3}{*}{\\\\work ~~Computation activities} & {\\\\texttt{calculator(formula:~str) -> value:~int | float}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & {\\\\texttt{python\\\\_interpreter(program:~str) -> result:~any}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & {\\\\texttt{worksheet.insert\\\\_row(row:~list, index:~int) -> None}} \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\midrule\\n    \\\\multirow{4}{*}{\\\\world ~~Interaction w/ the world} & \\\\texttt{get\\\\_weather(city\\\\_name:~str) -> weather:~str} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & \\\\texttt{get\\\\_location(ip:~str) -> location:~str} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & \\\\texttt{calendar.fetch\\\\_events(date:~str) -> events:~list} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & \\\\texttt{email.verify(address:~str) -> result:~bool} \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\midrule\\n    \\\\multirow{3}{*}{\\\\modal ~~Non-textual modalities} & \\\\texttt{cat\\\\_image.delete(image\\\\_id:~str) -> None} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & \\\\texttt{spotify.play\\\\_music(name:~str) -> None} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & \\\\texttt{visual\\\\_qa(query:~str, image:~Image) -> answer:~str} \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\midrule\\n    \\\\multirow{2}{*}{\\\\nn ~~Special-skilled LMs} & {\\\\texttt{QA(question:~str) -> answer:~str}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {} & \\\\texttt{translation(text:~str, language:~str) -> text:~str} \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\bottomrule\\n    \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\\\vspace{-2mm}\\n\\\\caption{Exemplar tools for each category.}\\n\\\\vspace{-15mm}\\n\\\\label{tab:example-tools}\\n\\\\end{table}}\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Scenarios where tools are useful}\\n\\\\label{sec:scenarios}\\n\\nWhile LMs may easily learn to do many tasks to high accuracy without tools, many other tasks greatly benefit from tool use.\\nIn this section, we study a broad range of scenarios where tools have been used to assist agents.

For instance, LMs can access real-time information such as weather \\\\citep{xu2023tool,tang2023toolalpaca}, or positional knowledge such as location \\\\citep{qin2023toolllm}. On the other hand, LMs can manipulate real-world information such as managing calendars \\\\citep{schick2023toolformer} and emails \\\\citep{qin2023toolllm}.\\nIn addition to web-based activities, LMs can engage in physical activities in embodied environments, such as fishing with rods or mining with axes in the Minecraft world \\\\citep{wang2023voyager}; further propagate to the real-world tasks to perform cooking \\\\citep{singh2022progprompt,shridhar2020alfred}, plotting \\\\citep{liang2023code}, and even conducting chemical research \\\\citep{boiko2023autonomous}.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{\\\\raisebox{-0.5mm}{\\\\includegraphics[width=4mm]{./figures/icon/media-icon.png}} Non-textual modalities} \\\\quad\\nWhile many LMs only consume and generate texts, some works bring in access to visual \\\\citep{gupta2022visual,suris2023vipergpt}, audio \\\\citep{yang2023mmreact,gao2023assistgpt}, or other modalities. For example, LMs can access images with \\\\texttt{cat\\\\_image} APIs \\\\citep{xu2023tool,tang2023toolalpaca} or songs \\\\citep{huang2024metatool} provided by \\\\texttt{spotify}, even answer questions about them \\\\citep{gupta2022visual,gao2023assistgpt}.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{\\\\raisebox{-0.5mm}{\\\\includegraphics[width=4mm]{./figures/icon/brain-icon.png}} Accessing specialized LMs} \\\\quad\\nSome works propose to use specialized LMs as tools, essentially using the main LM as a task planner to dispatch requests to other LMs.\\n\\\\citet{schick2023toolformer} propose QA models to fill in factoid details in responses, \\\\citet{thoppilan2022lamda,schick2023toolformer,paranjape2023art} use machine translation models to assist multilingual tasks. Beyond specific tasks, some works adopt multiple neural models from Hugginface or similar platforms \\\\citep{patil2023gorilla,shen2023hugginggpt}, or further fine-tune them on various data \\\\citep{viswanathan2023prompt2model}.\\nCompared to the base LM, these tool models mainly vary in their specialized skills, and may or may not have substantial architectural differences from the base LMs.\\n\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Where are tools \\\\emph{not} useful?}\\n\\\\label{sub:not-useful}\\n\\nDespite the fact that tools can be helpful under many scenarios discussed above, it is also important to note scenarios where tools are arguably not very helpful.\\nSome examples of tasks where tools have not (yet) been used to great effect include machine translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis (among others).\\nThese are tasks that are not easy to perform using non-ML methods (c.f.~solving math problems or accessing databases, which can be done using a calculator or SQL), and can be performed with high accuracy by a powerful LM alone.\\nOne intuitive reason is that the tools currently leveraged for these tasks are \\\\textit{neural networks} and have limited advantages over the base LM.\\nImagine if we leverage tools on these tasks, the tools would mostly generally be another neural LM with specialized skills, e.g., an LM specifically trained on many summarization datasets to perform this task. However, this special-skilled neural LM may not have significant architectural differences from the base tool-using LM, or be smaller in size or training tokens hence having inferior language modeling abilities in general.\\nIn comparison, the base LM capable of solution planning and tool management, usually are more powerful (e.g., GPT-4) and can achieve reasonable performance on a wide variety of tasks, perhaps even outperforming special-purpose LMs \\\\citep{robinson-etal-2023-chatgpt}.\\n\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/my_paper/sections/3_advanced.tex:\\n\\\\section{Advanced tool-use methods}\\n\\\\label{sec:methods}\\n\\nGiven this understanding of the basic tooling paradigm and the scenarios in which tools are useful, we now discuss more advanced approaches for tools.\\nConcretely, we study multi-tool selection and usage (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:tool-select}), complex tooling under programmatic contexts (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:tools-and-programs}), and creation of tools when they are not available a-priori (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:make-tool}). \\n\\n\\n% #########################\\n\\\\subsection{Complex tool selection and usage}\\n\\\\label{sub:tool-select}\\n\\nDepending on the number of tools available, the system may include an implicit or explicit tool selection module.\\nIf tools are already \\\\textit{designated} for the task \\\\citep{lazaridou2022internetaugmented,thoppilan2022lamda}, then no tool selection is needed.\\nIf \\\\textit{a small number} (e.g., 5--10) of tools are available, metadata and use cases of these tools can be provided as input contexts along with the user query \\\\citep{schick2023toolformer,paranjape2023art}, and LMs can directly select tools from contexts via a standard generation process.\\nIf the toolbox size \\\\textit{further grows} (e.g., to hundreds), fitting all tools into model inputs is not feasible. Thus an extra retrieval step is often incorporated: a retriever model short-lists the most relevant tools and feeds their metadata to the solution-generation LM. Specifically, \\\\citet{zhou2023docprompting,qin2023toolllm} train retriever models that map NL intents to tool documentation.\\n\\\\citet{yuan2023craft} ask LMs to write hypothetical descriptions and use the SimCSE retriever \\\\citep{} to find similar tools. More easily, one can directly use off-the-shelf embeddings \\\\citep{SFRAIResearch2024,openai-emb} or training-free sparse retrievers \\\\citep{robertson2009probabilistic}.\\n\\n\\n% \\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Complex, multi-tool usage} \\\\quad\\nFor complex queries that require multiple tools to solve, the common approach so far is to break down the task and tackle each step sequentially \\\\citep{paranjape2023art} by selecting and using tools with intermediate contexts.\\nHowever, this sequential multi-turn paradigm may not be reflective of more complex or realistic usage of the involved tools. For example, a user may prefer \\\\textit{nested} function calls \\\\texttt{check\\\\_weather(get\\\\_local\\\\_time(`Pittsburgh'))} to allow information hiding or encapsulation \\\\citep{rogers2001encapsulation}, \\\\textit{parallel} calls to reduce round trips with the API \\\\citep{eleti2023function}, or \\\\textit{iterative} calls \\\\texttt{buy\\\\_ticket(event)} in a loop until it returns \\\\texttt{True} to indicate a successful transaction. \\n\\n\\n% ################################\\n\\\\subsection{Tools in programmatic contexts}\\n\\\\label{sub:tools-and-programs}\\n\\nUnlike text-based tasks where tools are auxiliary modules to extend LM abilities, on programmatic tasks, where code LMs can solve the problem by generating programs, tools can be seen as compositions of basic functions.\\nIn this part, we discuss tools in programmatic tasks for domain-specific (\\\\S\\\\ref{}) and general-purpose problems (\\\\S\\\\ref{}).\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Focus on varied tools} \\\\quad\\nDepending on the tasks of interest, existing works focus on different types of tools under programmatic contexts. With the increasing complexity of these tools and presumably a decreasing familiarity of LMs about them, there are works that adopt (i) \\\\textcolor{candypink}{\\\\textit{built-in functions}} of a programming language (PL) to augment LMs in symbolic reasoning, (ii) \\\\textcolor{ao!80}{\\\\textit{external libraries}} in pre-designed packages to tackle complex open-domain coding queries \\\\citep{wang2023execution}, and (iii) \\\\textcolor{blue(ncs)}{\\\\textit{utility functions}} unseen at training time to solve specific tasks.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[ht]\\n\\\\centering\\n\\\\vspace{-1mm}\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\textwidth]{./figures/codelm-tools.pdf}\\n\\\\vspace{-6mm}\\n\\\\caption{Relative to what is considered as the base LM or base actions, tools can refer to built-in functions, external libraries, or task-specific utility functions (from left to right).}\\n\\\\vspace{-1mm}\\n\\\\label{fig:codelm-tools}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\n\\n\\n% ############\\n\\\\subsubsection{Domain-specific semantic parsing}\\n\\\\label{sub:domain-spec}\\n\\nNL-to-code generation systems have been studied for many years on special-domain tasks such as querying databases \\\\citep{zelle1996learning,zettlemoyer2012learning} or knowledge graphs \\\\citep{berant2013semantic}. Code produced by these systems is often domain-specific logical forms (DSL) manually designed by experts, such as lambda expressions \\\\citep{liang2013lambda} or SQL queries \\\\citep{yu2018spider}, and more recently, the QDMR grammar \\\\citep{wolfson2020break} as an extension to SQL.\\nIn addition to knowledge-oriented tasks, many agentic tasks adopt DSL to operate in corresponding environments, such as \\\\texttt{click} or \\\\texttt{type} in web navigation \\\\citep{zheran2018reinforcement,webshop2022yao,zhou2024webarena}, \\\\texttt{placeItem} and \\\\texttt{killMob} in the embodied Minecraft world \\\\citep{wang2023voyager}, or \\\\texttt{set\\\\_joint\\\\_target} for robot dogs \\\\citep{yu2023language}.\\nBecause DSLs are often specific enough to the target problems, most works directly use these \\\\textcolor{candypink}{built-in actions}.\\nYet still, for complex task queries, solution programs written in basic DSL actions alone can be hard to interpret or cumbersome to use, e.g., it is hard to tell that the lambda expression \\\\texttt{(fold xs ($\\\\lambda$ (n x) (+ 1 n)) 0)} is to calculate the length of \\\\texttt{xs}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% ############\\n\\\\subsubsection{General-purpose code generation}\\n\\\\label{sub:general-codegen}\\nRecent code generation systems have expanded from using DSL to more general-purpose PLs such as Python or Java \\\\citep{yin-neubig-2017-syntactic,chen2021evaluating}. These languages enable more programming flexibility and readily apply to versatile scenarios. \\nAs we have introduced using \\\\textcolor{candypink}{built-in actions} as tools in \\\\S\\\\ref{sub:app-spec}, we discuss more on two other\\ncommon categories of tools for code LMs, namely \\\\textcolor{ao!90}{\\\\textit{external libraries}} and task-specific \\\\textcolor{blue(ncs)}{\\\\textit{utility functions}}.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{External libraries} \\\\quad\\nFrom the usage of PLs, built-in functions are internal to whichever environment, whereas third-party libraries lie externally and need to be imported to tackle specific contexts, such as \\\\autoref{} (middle). Aligning with this conception, \\\\citet{zhang2023toolcoder} use Python libraries such as \\\\texttt{matplotlib} to plot figures and \\\\texttt{pandas} to manage data.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Utility functions} \\\\quad\\nFor more task-specific applications,\\nexpert-crafted utility functions, usually unseen at training time, are incorporated as tools. E.g., in \\\\autoref{fig:codelm-tools} (right), the highlighted \\\\texttt{locate\\\\_objects} function is designed by human experts \\\\citep{gupta2022visual,suris2023vipergpt} to load neural models and perform post-processing to obtain the detected box region. In a similar spirit, \\\\citet{cheng2023binding} use GPT as a tool to query world facts external to the tabular contents, \\\\citet{cao2023api} further design macro operation APIs to support advanced tabular operations.\\nHowever, because human tool curation requires expertise and effort, some works explore using LMs to automatically create tools instead.\\n\\n\\n\\n% ################################\\n\\n\\\\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{r}{0.40\\\\textwidth}\\n\\\\vspace{-6mm}\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.39\\\\textwidth]{./figures/make-tool.pdf}\\n\\\\vspace{-2mm}\\n\\\\caption{LM makes tools when no tools readily apply to the task.}\\n% \\\\vspace{-1mm}\\n\\\\label{fig:make-tool}\\n\\\\end{wrapfigure}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Tool creation and reuse}\\n\\\\label{sub:make-tool}\\n\\n\\nWhile one can readily use tools for tasks equipped with pre-designed tools, for tasks that do not have readily-applicable, human-created tools, some works explore using LMs to make tools and use them.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Domain-specific library abstraction} \\\\quad\\nWorks that use DSLs often compose frequently-used-together actions as shortcut tools. For example, \\\\citet{ellis2023dreamcoder} learn function abstractions such as \\\\texttt{length} and \\\\texttt{count\\\\_to} from lambda primitives (e.g., \\\\texttt{$0$}, \\\\texttt{+}) for the list processing task. \\n\\\\citet{pmlr-v139-wong21a,bowers2023top} similarly build functions bottom-up from a large corpus of DSL programs. More recently, \\\\citet{grand2023lilo} use LLMs to abstract libraries with auto-documentation. \\nFurther for agentic tasks, \\\\citet{zheran2018reinforcement} learn common workflows to guide web navigation, such as composing the basic $\\\\{$\\\\texttt{click}, \\\\texttt{like}$\\\\}$ actions to form a higher-level login action \\\\texttt{click(like(`login'))}.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{General-purpose tool making} \\\\quad\\nNonetheless, on general-purpose PLs, running the DSL-oriented methods above may expand their search space and limit their scalability. Instead, recent works often leverage LMs' procedural knowledge to alleviate the search issue. \\nTo start, \\\\citet{wang2023voyager} designs an automatic learning curriculum in Minecraft to make and use Java program tools.\\nLATM \\\\citep{} use LMs to build, verify, and use Python tools on BigBench \\\\citep{srivastava2023beyond} tasks, where however, all examples require the same single tool hence have limited difficulty.\\nCREATOR \\\\citep{qian2023creator} extend tool-making to harder tasks such as math and table world problems, and improves task success by creating tools yet repetitively for individual examples, thus CRAFT \\\\citep{yuan2023craft} add heuristic-based training to craft less repetitive tools.\\nTowards more efficient pipelines, ReGAL \\\\citep{stengeleskin2024regal} learns from refactoring a smaller number of programs, while TroVE \\\\citep{wang2024trove} purely relies on inference-time execution signal and induces reusable tools on-the-fly.\\n\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/my_paper/sections/4_evaluation.tex:\\n\\\\section{How to evaluate tool use?}\\n\\\\label{sec:good-tool}\\n\\nIn this section, we study existing LM-tooling benchmarks (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:testbeds}) and their evaluation metrics (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:eval-metrics}), lastly, we discuss the missing yet important evaluation aspects of tools (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:desired-properties}).\\n\\n% ############\\n\\\\subsection{Testbeds for evaluating tools}\\n\\\\label{sub:testbeds}\\nLM tool use can be evaluated on (i) repurposed existing datasets that can additionally benefit from tools (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:existing-dataset}), and (ii) newly crafted benchmarks that necessitate tool use (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:api-benchmark}).\\n\\n% ############\\n\\\\subsubsection{Repurposed Existing Datasets}\\n\\\\label{sub:existing-dataset}\\nMany tasks are solvable by using LMs, yet often with great difficulty or inefficiency. Therefore, some works use tool-augmented LMs as an alternative approach to solve these tasks. \\n\\nMany of these datasets require \\\\textbf{reasoning}. Starting from when questions are expressed in NL, such as complex reasoning with the Big-bench \\\\citep{srivastava2023beyond} dataset, mathematical problems with the MATH \\\\citep{hendrycks2021measuring} dataset, and reasoning over world knowledge to answer questions in NaturalQuestions \\\\citep{kwiatkowski2019natural} and TriviaQA \\\\citep{joshi2017triviaqa} datasets.\\nBeyond free-form texts, datasets that require reasoning over \\\\textbf{structured data} can also benefit from tools. These tasks include table-based QA with tabular math world problems in TabMWP \\\\citep{lu2023dynamic}, Wikipedia tables in WTQ \\\\citep{pasupat-liang-2015-compositional}, and complex-structured tables in HiTab \\\\citep{cheng-etal-2022-hitab}.\\nBeyond the text modality, datasets that require reasoning over \\\\textbf{other modalities} also benefit from modality-extending tools, e.g., answering questions about an image with the GQA \\\\citep{hudson2019gqa} dataset, or image pairs with the NLVR2 dataset \\\\citep{suhr2019corpus}.\\n\\nBecause tool use is proposed as an alternative method to solve these datasets, evaluations of these tool-augmented systems follow the standard evaluation process for individual datasets. Concretely, almost all tasks are measured by answer exact match, either in textual or numerical formats.\\nNote that, to obtain the final answers for lexical matching evaluations, all tool-calling expressions \\\\textbf{need to be executed}, and the execution outputs are incorporated into the final answers produced by the tool-augmented systems, as introduced in \\\\S\\\\ref{sec:basic-paradigm}.\\n\\n% ############\\n\\\\subsubsection{Aggregated API Benchmarks}\\n\\\\label{sub:api-benchmark}\\nExisting benchmarks can only benefit from a limited set of tools, yet there are far more tools we can utilize to perform versatile tasks in the real world, particularly the API tools created by human developers spread on the web. \\nTherefore, many recent works aggregate API tools from various web sources and create benchmarks for using these APIs, as shown in \\\\autoref{tab:api-benchmarks}.\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}[ht]\\n\\\\small\\n\\\\vspace{-1mm}\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n    \\\\begin{tabular}{l|lllc}\\n    \\\\toprule\\n    \\\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\\\textbf{Benchmark}} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Tool Source}} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Example Curation}} & \\\\textbf{Domain (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:app-spec})} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Executable}} \\\\\\\\ \\n    \\\\midrule\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.xu2023tool}{ToolBench$_1$}} & {existing dataset} & {adopted, human annotated} & {\\\\work, \\\\world} & {\\\\ding{51}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.qin2023toolllm}{ToolBench$_2$}} & {RapidAPI} & {model synthesized} & {\\\\work, \\\\world} & {\\\\ding{51}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.zhuang2023toolqa}{ToolQA}} & {existing dataset} & {model synthesized} & {\\\\work, \\\\kn} & {\\\\ding{51}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.tang2023toolalpaca}{ToolAlpaca}} & {PublicAPIs} & {model synthesized} & {\\\\kn, \\\\work, \\\\world, \\\\modal} & {\\\\ding{55}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.li-etal-2023-api}{API-Bank}} & {PublicAPIs} & {human annotated} & {\\\\work, \\\\world} & {\\\\ding{51}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.huang2024metatool}{MetaTool}} & {OpenAI Plugins} & {model synthesized} & {\\\\work, \\\\world, \\\\modal} & {\\\\ding{55}} \\\\\\\\\\n    % \\\\midrule\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.patil2023gorilla}{Gorilla}} & {HF, Torch, TF} & {model synthesized} & {\\\\nn} & {\\\\ding{55}} \\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.shen2023hugginggpt}{HuggingGPT}} & {HF} & {human annotated} & {\\\\nn} & {$~~$\\\\ding{55}$^{*}$}\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\hyperlink{cite.shen2023taskbench}{Task Bench}} & {HF, PublicAPIs} & {model synthesized} & {\\\\nn, \\\\modal, \\\\world} & {\\\\ding{55}} \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\bottomrule\\n    \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\\\vspace{-3mm}\\n\\\\caption{Benchmarks of providing aggregated APIs to LMs as tools. \\nHF is short for HuggingFace. `\\\\ding{55}$^{*}$' means that: though tools employed by HuggingGPT are executable, it does not evaluate the execution output due to the cost of hosting and inferencing.}\\n\\\\vspace{-1mm}\\n\\\\label{tab:api-benchmarks}\\n\\\\end{table}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Tool sources} \\\\quad\\nTools are mainly aggregated from existing datasets or public APIs.\\nWhile \\\\citet{xu2023tool,zhuang2023toolqa} adopt existing datasets and propose alternative methods via tool augmentation, these benchmarks are limited in domains. Several works scrape more APIs from online sources such as Public APIs \\\\citep{tang2023toolalpaca}, RESTful APIs \\\\citep{tang2023toolalpaca}, or the OpenAI plugin list \\\\citep{huang2024metatool}. Beyond human-crafted APIs \\\\citep{li-etal-2023-api}, neural models from ML platforms can be similarly presented in an API format \\\\citep{patil2023gorilla,shen2023hugginggpt,shen2023taskbench}. \\nNonetheless, as tools are collected from heterogeneous sources, it is challenging to select the best benchmark or unify all these varied benchmarks.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Example curation} \\\\quad\\nExamples can be adopted from existing datasets, annotated by humans, or synthesized by LMs.\\nWhile most examples adopted from existing datasets are human annotated \\\\citep{xu2023tool}, only \\\\citet{li-etal-2023-api} do so for scraped APIs, by surveying 500 people and creating 314 dialogues manually.\\nMost other works prompt GPT models to synthesize examples \\\\citep{qin2023toolllm,tang2023toolalpaca,shen2023taskbench,zhuang2023toolqa, huang2024metatool}, however, leading to issues of \\\\textit{naturalness} and \\\\textit{executability}.\\n\\n\\\\textbf{First}, LMs are often asked to create examples, even tool outputs in \\\\citet{tang2023toolalpaca}, given a heuristically selected set of tools. This approach leads to potential issues in two-fold: (i) the selected tools may not be used together in practice, and (ii) the synthesized examples may not reflect the \\\\textit{natural use cases} of these tools.\\n\\\\textbf{Second}, 5 out of 9 benchmarks in \\\\autoref{tab:api-benchmarks} do not support tool execution, to alleviate the cost of hosting multiple APIs, especially when they may fail or produce unstable outputs. For example, the weather returned by the \\\\texttt{check\\\\_weather} API may change over time. This un-executability causes \\\\textit{issues in evaluation}. Instead of matching final execution results using lexical- \\\\citep{li-etal-2023-api} or neural-based metrics \\\\citep{tang2023toolalpaca, qin2023toolllm}, works with unexecutable tools resort to pseudo matching of API calling expressions with lexical~\\\\citep{tang2023toolalpaca,shen2023hugginggpt,huang2024metatool} and syntactical \\\\citep{patil2023gorilla, shen2023taskbench} means.\\n\\n\\n\\n% #################################\\n\\\\subsection{What metrics are measured now?}\\n\\\\label{sub:eval-metrics}\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Task completion} \\\\quad\\nTools are used to assist task solving. Most works that allow tool execution evaluate the task completion score to quantify the effectiveness of utilizing tools.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Tool selection} \\\\quad\\nFor datasets with execution issues \\\\citep{huang2024metatool,shen2023taskbench}, another common metric is the accuracy of selecting the correct tools. This helps disentangle incorrect tool selection errors from inaccurate tool usage errors. \\nDespite that tool selection mainly serves as a proxy for evaluating task completion when having unexecutable tools, it can be seen as a measure of LM planning abilities --- the process of breaking down a task into multiple steps and selecting tools to complete individual steps.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Tool reusability} \\\\quad\\nWhile tool reusability is often deemed important in took-making literature \\\\citep{cai2023large,yuan2023craft}, only \\\\citet{wang2024trove} evaluates tool reusability by the size of induced toolboxes over a fixed number of examples. As its literal meaning, reusable tools can be (re)used to solve multiple examples hence having more generic functionalities. Adopting a reusable tool is more efficient than using multiple specific tools, and facilitates human verification in both speed and accuracy dimensions \\\\citep{wang2024trove}.\\n\\n\\n% #################################\\n\\\\subsection{What properties are missing?}\\n\\\\label{sub:desired-properties}\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Efficiency of tool integration} \\\\quad\\nAs demonstrated by our empirical study (\\\\S\\\\ref{sub:trade-off}), the benefits brought by the tools come with the cost of additional computation, especially for teaching LMs to use tools via training or prompting. In addition to performance gain, reporting the computation overhead can enable fairer comparisons between different approaches.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Quality of tools} \\\\quad\\nWhile existing works mostly focus on how tools improve task accuracy, the \\\\textit{performance of tools} themselves is also important. Tool performance can cover multiple aspects such as completing the call quickly, requiring less computation, and not putting users at risk or failing unexpectedly. \\nOne way to measure these aspects is to conduct API testing \\\\citep{yasar2022software,ehsan2022restful} on their runtime, memory usage, and success rate.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Reliability of unstable tools} \\\\quad\\nParticularly for tools that involve \\\\textit{neural models} or \\\\textit{randomized components}, their output quality may be unstable and unpredictable. For example, the \\\\texttt{VQA} tool \\\\citep{gupta2022visual} may answer some questions correctly but others incorrectly.\\nIt is important to \\\\textit{be aware of} this uncertainty in contrast to stable, rule-based tools such as a \\\\texttt{calculator}, further alleviate this instability and guarantee more predictable outputs.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Reproducible testing} \\\\quad\\nMany tools interact with the real world and may return different results at different times. For example, \\\\texttt{check\\\\_weather} may return ``sunny'' today but ``cloudy'' tomorrow. This irreproducible behavior poses great challenges to creating \\\\textit{static evaluation} benchmarks with reference answers. % For instance, the answer to ``How's the weather today?'' should not be a fixed ``sunny'', because the correct answer may change according to the specific time of evaluation.\\nWhile some works alleviate this by evaluating API calls without executing them, a more rigorous method could be \\\\textit{parallel testing} \\\\citep{sharma2018automated} --- executing the model-generated program and the reference program in parallel, and measuring if their final outputs match.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Safe usage} \\\\quad\\nMost systems may only opt to use tools if they are trusted to be secure \\\\citep{barbir2007challenges}.\\nAt the very least, users favor tools that can be easily understood and verified. Further, systems may need to enforce mutual authentication and ensure data integrity \\\\citep{ehsan2022restful}.\\nYet there are more security threats and methods beyond the discussion here. We encourage readers to peruse the referenced works above for thorough studies.\\n\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/my_paper/sections/5_tradeoff.tex:\\n\\\\section{Trade-offs in tool usage}\\n\\\\label{sub:trade-off}\\n\\nLeveraging tools often brings better performance, however, should we always use tools?

While other tasks improve less, multilingual tasks even degrade by $-0.2$ points, despite using a similar amount of compute. This variance across tasks aligns with expectations: using a \\\\texttt{calculator} tool greatly improves the arithmetic ability of probabilistic LMs, which are not naturally suitable for symbolic calculations; however, LMs are originally built to solve language tasks such as machine translation (MT), so assigning the MT task to another (usually smaller) LM may not bring substantial improvements.\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{r}{0.33\\\\textwidth}\\n\\\\vspace{-2mm}\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=0.32\\\\textwidth]{./figures/tool-make-cost.pdf}\\n\\\\vspace{-3mm}\\n\\\\caption{Comparing different tool-making methods.}\\n\\\\vspace{-1mm}\\n\\\\label{fig:tool-make-cost}\\n\\\\end{wrapfigure}\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{What methods are efficient in tool-making?} \\\\quad\\nWhile it is hard to conduct fair comparisons for many works experimenting on different datasets, in tool-making scenarios (\\\\autoref{fig:tool-make-cost}), the three methods (Creator, CRAFT, \\\\textsc{TroVE}) experiment on the same MATH and TabMWP datasets, thus enabling fair comparisons in both cost and performance dimensions.\\n\\\\textsc{TroVE} appears to be the most efficient method in general, costing only $1.2$--$1.4$K tokens while improving the performance by $12.0$--$21.0$ points in accuracy. \\nIn contrast, CREATOR and CRAFT are less efficient, costing $3.8$--$6.0$ times of compute, yet achieve only minimal ($0.0$--$4.5$\\\\%) or comparable ($4.1$--$5.0$\\\\%) accuracy increases.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Training-time vs inference-time cost} \\\\quad\\nTraining-time and inference-time costs may not be equally important to many practitioners, since inference may be run many times but training often only needs to be done once.\\\\footnote{Another measure of the inference process is latency, which also heavily depends on implementation or hardware choices. We do not report latency since these methods are implemented differently.} If we only consider inference-time cost in \\\\autoref{tab:compute-cost}, the efficiency ranking of tooling methods changes. On one hand, tool-making method rankings roughly remain the same, except that CRAFT requires less compute than CREATOR on both tasks after getting rid of the training cost.\\nOn the other hand, however, the ranking among tool-using methods drastically changes: ToolFormer requires more compute than API-Bank and ToolAlpaca when considering only inference-time cost. We conjecture this is mainly due to differences in baseline setups: ToolFormer adds in-context examples than the CoT baseline, API-Bank and ToolAlpaca use the same prompt for baseline and fine-tuned LMs with varied abilities to utilize tools presented in the prompt.\\nIn general, if the user has sufficient budgets for training but higher demands on inference-time efficiency, the training approaches proposed by API-Bank and ToolAlpaca could be more suitable.\\n\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/my_paper/sections/conclusion.tex:\\n\\\\section{Final Remarks}\\nOur survey provides definitions for LM-used tools and systematic summaries of existing approaches.

Because the parameter size $D$ of closed-source GPT is unknown, we only measure the number of extra tokens $N$ per example (\\\\autoref{fig:overall-cost}, right). \\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[ht]\\n\\\\centering\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\textwidth]{./figures/compute-cost.pdf}\\n\\\\vspace{-6mm}\\n\\\\caption{Computation cost of different approaches using open-source (left) and closed-source (right) models, and their performance gain on experimented datasets.

In general, the computation cost is majorly affected by (1) the number of tokens processed, and (2) the parameter size of models.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{API-Bank \\\\citep{li-etal-2023-api}} \\\\quad\\nThis work trains the Lynx model that uses tools to solve problems in the proposed API-Bank dataset. The Lynx model is initialized by Alpaca 7B parameters, and trained on the API-Bank training set with 3 epochs. Therefore, we adopt the Alpaca 7B as the baseline and Lynx as the tool-using model, where the 3-epoch training is the additional computation cost introduced to enable tool use.\\nWe calculate the total number of tokens involved in the training process, including the example i/o and additional instructions. \\nBecause the baseline and proposed method use the same prompt at inference time, no additional computation is required.\\nRegarding task performance, we adopt the total correctness across all evaluation systems, as reported in Table 3. We report the difference between the fine-tuned Lynx-7B and the zero-shot Alpaca-7B.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{ToolAlpaca \\\\citep{tang2023toolalpaca}} \\\\quad\\nThis work proposes the ToolAlpaca dataset and trains Vicuna models to use tools. The baseline models are Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B models. The trained tool-using models are called ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B models. All ToolAlpaca models are trained on the training split for 3 epochs, so we estimate the cost during this training process for 7B and 13B models, respectively.\\nWe adopt the `overall' results reported in Table 3, on examples with both simulated tools and real-world APIs, and report their average results. We measure the performance gain by the difference between the ToolAlpaca-7/13B and Vicuna-7/13B. \\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Toolformer \\\\citep{schick2023toolformer}} \\\\quad\\nThis work integrates five tools --- question answering system, calculator, Wikipedia search, machine translation system, and calendar --- respectively for five tasks transformed from a subset of CCNet \\\\citep{wenzek2020ccnet}.\\nStarting with GPT-J models \\\\citep{wang2021gpt-j} as the no-tool baseline, they train on 25$k$ model-synthesized examples for each tool and obtain the Toolformer models, causing a total of 1$M$ FLOPs for each task. At inference time, they add special instruction and in-context examples to prompt tool using, resulting in extra compute.\\nBecause each task contains multiple datasets, we report the average results to represent the general task performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n% ######################\\n\\\\subsection{Models with unknown size}\\n\\nWhile many of the works use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models that do not release their parameter size, we estimate the cost by using the number of tokens processed in extra modules.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{Chameleon \\\\citep{lu2023chameleon}} \\\\quad \\nThis work proposes to take a tool-augmented approach to improve on two existing datasets --- ScienceQA and TabMWP. Because all experiments use ChatGPT and GPT-4 models, whose parameter sizes are unknown, we only examine results with (the better) GPT-4 model to fairly compare with other methods using GPT-4. \\nSpecifically for the ScienceQA dataset, we adopt the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline reported in the paper, and report task accuracy as in the \\\\textsc{All} column in Table 3. We calculate the difference in number of tokens between the proposed Chameleon methods against the CoT baseline.\\nFor the TabMWP dataset, we adopt the Program-of-Thought (PoT) baseline and similarly calculate the token number difference using the provided results.\\\\footnote{\\\\url{https://github.com/lupantech/chameleon-llm}} We adopt numbers in the \\\\textsc{All} column in Table 4 as the TabMWP accuracy. \\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{LATM \\\\citep{cai2023large}} \\\\quad\\nThis work proposes to use LMs to make tools for individual tasks in BigBench. Compared to the chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline, the proposed LATM method integrates training, validation, and inference stages to make tools and solve questions. We estimate the compute cost by the additional number of tokens used for LATM than for CoT.\\nWe measure each method by averaging its accuracy across all six selected tasks.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{CRAFT \\\\citep{yuan2023craft}} \\\\quad\\nThis work uses LMs to make tools for math, table, and image reasoning tasks. We calculate the number of tokens used during training and inference, using its released code and data.\\\\footnote{\\\\url{https://github.com/lifan-yuan/CRAFT}}\\nCRAFT similarly implements CoT as the baseline, and proposes further training, verification, and finally testing in the CRAFT method. \\nWe report its task accuracy on the representative datasets from each task --- MATH, TabMWP, and GQA --- to enable fairer comparison with other works having overlapping datasets.\\n\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{CREATOR \\\\citep{qian2023creator}} \\\\quad\\nAs a prior work for CRAFT, CREATOR similarly tests on MATH and table tasks, but designs its methods differently. In addition to CoT, this work implements a stronger program-oriented baseline called Program-of-Thought (PoT). We also adopt PoT as the main baseline without tool making or using. The CREATOR method operates at test time, with multiple steps through tool making, solution generation, verification, rectification, etc. We calculate the difference in number of tokens between the CREATOR approach and the baseline PoT setting.\\nWe adopt the task accuracy reported in Table 2 (MATH) and Table 3 (TabMWP) from the original paper.\\n\\n\\\\noindent \\\\textbf{TroVE \\\\citep{wang2024trove}} \\\\quad\\nTroVE also induces tools without training supervision. This work adopts the primitive baseline, a presumably stronger version of PoT yet without much textual explanation. The main implementation change in TroVE is the three-mode generation and multi-candidate sampling. We calculate the additional tokens used in TroVE compared to the primitive baseline.\\nThe dataset reports task accuracy, solution complexity, and toolbox size, we only adopt the task accuracy to fairly compare with other works.\\n\\n\\n% \\\\begin{figure}[ht]\\n% \\\\centering\\n% % \\\\vspace{-1mm}\\n% \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\textwidth]{./figures/inference-cost.pdf}\\n% \\\\vspace{-6mm}\\n% \\\\caption{Performance gain versus inference-time computation cost.}\\n% \\\\vspace{-3mm}\\n% \\\\label{fig:inference-cost}\\n% \\\\end{figure}\\n\\n\\n% \\\\begin{table}[ht]\\n% \\\\small\\n% \\\\begin{center}\\n% \\\\resizebox{0.92\\\\linewidth}{!}{\\n%     \\\\begin{tabular}{ll}\\n%     \\\\toprule\\n%     \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Missing aspects}} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\\\textbf{Potential metrics}} \\\\\\\\\\n%     \\\\midrule\\n%     {Efficiency of tool integration} & {computation overhead} \\\\\\\\\\n%     {Quality of tools} & {runtime and memory usage of tools} \\\\\\\\\\n%     {Reliability of unstable tools} & {success rate of tools} \\\\\\\\\\n%     {Reproducible testing} & {execution correctness w.r.t. canonical trajectory} \\\\\\\\\\n%     {Safe usage} & {visibility, data integrity, and other meta-data about tools} \\\\\\\\\\n%     \\\\bottomrule\\n%     \\\\end{tabular}\\n%     }\\n% \\\\end{center}\\n% \\\\caption{Missing evaluation aspects and potential metrics.}\\n% \\\\label{tab:missing-eval}\\n% \\\\end{table}\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/my_paper/appendix/embodied.tex:\\n\\\\section{Tools with embodied agents}\\n\\\\label{sec:embodied}\\n\\n\\\\zwcomment{merge related works to earlier sections and remove this section?}\\n\\nIn previous sections, we discuss LM-used tools in NLP task environments. In the last part of this survey, we broaden our discussion about tools to the agent-environment interaction setup. \\nSpecifically, we regard \\\\emph{agents} as the policies that interact with environments based on the perceived environmental state;\\\\footnote{We are specifically interested in LM-based agents, which use LM as a component.} and \\\\emph{environments} are the collections of objects and their relationships.\\\\footnote{In NLP tasks, an environment contains example contexts and the collection of tool environments.}\\nWhile most objects can be purposed as tools, e.g., brushes can be used to paint, brooms can reach high objects, % magnifiers can help read books,\\n% books can be used to hit nails into blocks, terminal can be used to execute a drawing program, \\nthe following definition captures the essence of tools:\\n\\n\\\\begin{definition}[Tools]\\n\\\\label{def:tools_broad}\\nTools are the objects in the environments that are not directly part of the goals of the agents, but are used by the agents in order to achieve the goals.\\n\\\\end{definition}\\n\\nFor example, when drawing a picture, $\\\\{$brush, paint, canvas$\\\\}$ are all used, but only the \\\\texttt{brush} is regarded as tools, since they are not part of the final product --- a picture.\\n% \\\\zwcomment{we could align what figure 4 draws to the examples we made below. it also helps that you could discuss the example by referring to the illustration}\\n% For example, when making a hamburger, stove, toaster, pans, breads, patties, tomatoes, and cabbages are all used, but only stove, toasters, and pans are regarded as tools, since they are not part of final product, a hamburger. \\nIt should be noted that an object can be a tool for one task but not a tool for another, e.g. a \\\\texttt{calculator} is a tool when finding the root of an equation, but it is not a tool when a virtual agent is launching the calculator app.\\\\footnote{The definition of tools used by humans and non-human animals has been evolving in the past decades. Def. \\\\ref{def:tools_broad} is similar to \\\\citet{beauchamp2011oxford}, which defines tools as inanimate objects ``causing a change in the environment, thereby facilitating one's achievement of a target goal''.}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{wrapfigure}[18]{r}{0.43\\\\textwidth}\\n\\\\vspace{-4mm}\\n\\\\footnotesize\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=0.43\\\\textwidth]{figures/tool-survey-paradigm.pdf}\\n\\\\vspace{-6mm}\\n\\\\caption{The action-observation feedback loop: an agent interacts with an environment by acting (with tools) on other objects in the environment, and getting feedback reward from it.}\\n\\\\label{fig:agent-env}\\n\\\\end{wrapfigure}\\n\\n\\n\\nThe approaches for using tools under Def. \\\\ref{def:tools-lm} can also be applied to tools under Def. \\\\ref{def:tools_broad}, by implementing external functions composed of low-level manipulation policies. \\nThese composed functions are often \\\\textit{rule-based methods} or \\\\textit{magic functions} provided by the simulation environments (similar to works providing expert-designed APIs to LMs in \\\\S\\\\ref{sub:app-spec}). For example, \\\\citet{shridhar2020alfred} employ human-crafted APIs in the AI2THOR simulator \\\\citep{kolve2017ai2} to use microwaves and fridges to cool and heat objects.  \\n\\\\citet{wang2023voyager} use JavaScript APIs in Mineflayer\\\\footnote{\\\\url{https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer}} to manipulate Minecraft tools such as mining with axes. \\\\citet{liu2024agentbench} hand-craft the \\\\texttt{search} tool as Python functions to query data over the web, and \\\\citet{boiko2023autonomous} similarly for conducting chemical research.\\n\\nHowever, in the real world, not all high-level manipulation policies are readily available. For example, in \\\\citet{ahn2022saycan}, % although picking up sponges can be learned as a policy, \\nwiping tables with a sponge is too complex to be implemented as an action, hence is actually executed by humans.\\n% although picking up sponge is a learned subpolicy, wiping tables with a sponge is executed by humans. \\nNonetheless, instead of adopting readily available policies, these compositions can also be learned via behavior cloning and reinforcement learning.\\nFor instance, \\\\citet{baker2019emergent} show that tool use can be learned without expert demonstrations or rewarding signals, and \\\\citet{yu2023language} feed NL inputs to robots to learn skills such as picking up apples.\\n% More recently, \\\\citet{ahn2022saycan} also learn policies to pick up objects such as sponges.\\n\\nTraining and evaluating LMs and LM-based agents on their tooling abilities in the real world remain an open challenge.\\n% Training and evaluating LMs' and LM-based agents' ability to use tools in the real world remains an open question. \\nHere we highlight two future directions: (1) \\\\textit{building more complex environments}: with sufficient objects for versatile tool use and tool make, (2) \\\\textit{harness LM procedural knowledge}: LMs equip strong procedural knowledge via extensive training, which can be utilized to improve planning and navigation in complex, realistic environments. \\n\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/my_paper/colm2024_conference.bib:\\n@inproceedings{komeili-etal-2022-internet,\\n  title={Internet-Augmented Dialogue
