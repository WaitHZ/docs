Recent work has established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes disappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that\u2014after the disappearance of ICL\u2014the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights and in-context learning, which we term \u201ccontext-constrained in-weights learning\u201d (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually replaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL transience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually share sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For example, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only be enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL thus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term \u201cstrategy coopetition\u201d. We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key dynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.Lay Summary: In-context learning (ICL) is a key ability of modern large language models, allowing them to learn from context and adapt to new situations without being explicitly trained for them. Prior work has found that, in many cases of overtraining, classical in-context learning is actually transient, meaning it appears but then fades away. We reproduce this finding in a smaller scale setup, thus enabling mechanistic investigation. Through these investigations, we find that the asymptotic strategy (which emerges after ICL transience) is context-constrained in-weight learning (CIWL) -- namely, the model relies on associations learned in the past, but constrains the recall based on the current context. Competition for capacity leads CIWL to \\\"crowd out\\\" ICL, but surprisingly, cooperation between the two strategies is what leads to ICL emergence in the first place. We capture these \\\"coopetition\\\" dynamics in a toy model, which motivates an empirical setting where ICL is emergent and persistent. Overall, this work deepens our mechanistic understanding of how different strategies may tradeoff through during the course of transformer training.Link To Code: github.com/aadityasingh/icl-dynamicsPrimary Area: Deep Learning->Attention MechanismsKeywords: Mechanistic interpretability, transformers, in-context learning, transience, dynamics, Machine Learning, strategy, cooperation, competition, coopetitionSubmission Number: 5794LoadingAbout OpenReviewHosting a VenueAll VenuesContactSponsorsDonateFrequently Asked QuestionsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyAbout OpenReviewHosting a VenueAll VenuesSponsorsFrequently Asked QuestionsContactDonateTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyOpenReview is a long-term project to advance science through improved peer review with legal nonprofit status.

However, their confidence calibration is largely\\\\nunexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated\\\\npredictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and\\\\ndecision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the\\\\nfirst framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt\\\\noptimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration\\\\nobjectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that\\\\nattempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.\\\\nSecond, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature\\\\nproximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of\\\\nmultimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs\\\\nand five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently\\\\nimproves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy.

To address this limitation, we\\\\npropose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels\\\\nleveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event\\\\nstream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available\\\\noff-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,\\\\nwe propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),\\\\nor deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from\\\\nmonocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world\\\\ndatasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive\\\\nperformance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive\\\\ndepth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art\\\\nperformance.\\\",\\n      \\\"categories\\\": [\\n        \\\"cs.CV\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"published\\\": \\\"2025-09-18T17:59:51+00:00\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15224v1\\\",\\n      \\\"resource_uri\\\": \\\"arxiv://2509.15224v1\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"2509.15223v1\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Parameter sensitivity of cosmic pairwise velocities in the non-linear regime of structure formation\\\",\\n      \\\"authors\\\": [\\n        \\\"Jorge Enrique Garc\\\\u00eda-Farieta\\\",\\n        \\\"H\\\\u00e9ctor J.

Singh and 5 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful ability that emerges in transformer models, enabling them to learn from context without weight updates. Recent work has established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes disappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that, after the disappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights and in-context learning, which we term \\\"context-constrained in-weights learning\\\" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually replaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL transience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually share sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For example, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only be enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL thus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term \\\"strategy coopetition.\\\" We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key dynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.

ICL is striking not only for its power, but\\nalso because it emerges without being explicitly trained\\nfor (as Brown et al. (2020) first observed, when training\\ntransformer models on internet-scale language corpora.).\\nNewer work has shown that ICL can sometimes in fact\\ndisappear after emerging, i.e. it can be transient over the\\ncourse of training (Singh et al., 2023; Anand et al., 2024;\\nHe et al., 2024).\\nThis evolving picture of ICL necessitates a deeper under-\\nstanding of the dynamics of ICL emergence (and transience).\\nICL is often viewed to be in competition with other strate-\\ngies (Nguyen & Reddy, 2024; Park et al., 2024), such as\\nIWL, with the tradeoff thought to be modulated by data\\nproperties (Chan et al., 2022; 2024), model size (Wei et al.,\\n2023), and/or training time (Singh et al., 2023). While com-\\npetition may explain why ICL gives way to other strategies\\nthrough the course of training, the question remains: why\\ndoes it emerge in the first place (if only to fade away)?\\nIn this work, we aim to extend the mechanistic understand-\\ning of ICL, which currently focuses on induction heads\\n(Olsson et al., 2022) and their emergence dynamics (Singh\\net al., 2024), to a richer dynamical setting involving multiple\\nstrategies cycling in and out over the course of learning. To\\ndo so, we reproduce and investigate the key transience result\\nin a simplified synthetic data setting with a 2-layer attention-\\nonly transformer. Using behavioral evaluators, we find the\\nasymptotic strategy after the disappearance of ICL is not\\npure in-weights learning. Rather, it is a surprising hybrid\\nstrategy that we term context-constrained in-weights learn-\\ning (CIWL, Section 4). The implementation of CIWL takes\\nthe form of skip-trigrams (Elhage et al., 2021) distributed\\nacross multiple heads in a form of superposition (Elhage\\net al., 2022). Perhaps even more remarkably, we find that\\neven though CIWL dominates over ICL asymptotically, both\\nstrategies share critical sub-circuits (Section 5.1), indicating\\ncooperative dynamics between these seemingly competitive\\nmechanisms\u2014a phenomenon we term \u201cstrategy coopeti-\\ntion.\u201d We borrow the term \u201ccoopetition\u201d from game theory,\\nwhere it describes situations where competitors simultane-\\nously cooperate and compete with each other.1Cooperation\\n1A classic historical examples is Hollywood studios in the early\\n1arXiv:2503.05631v2  [cs.LG]  10 Mar 2025\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01F33ubNWjrVzNQKweH7DVPw"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect!

Yeh Department of Computer Science, Purdue University ICML 2025 (Oral) Code arXiv Paper Summary: We provide a theoretical framework for model immunization, showing how the condition number of the feature covariance matrix governs the ability to immunize models against harmful fine-tuning via linear probing, while preserving performance on benign tasks. Preliminaries Condition Number & Gradient Descent The condition number of a matrix $\\\\mathbf{S}$ is defined as \\\\[ \\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{S}) = \\\\|\\\\mathbf{S}\\\\|_2 \\\\|\\\\mathbf{S}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\|_2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf{S}}^{\\\\mathrm{max}}}{\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf{S}}^{\\\\mathrm{min}}} \\\\] where $\\\\dagger$ is the pseudoinverse and $\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf{S}}^{\\\\mathrm{max}}$, $\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf{S}}^{\\\\mathrm{min}}$ are the largest and smallest singular values. The convergence rate of gradient descent for strongly convex $\\\\mathcal{L}$ is: \\\\[ \\\\|\\\\mathbf{w}_t - \\\\mathbf{w}^\\\\ast\\\\|^2 \\\\leq \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^{\\\\mathrm{min}}}{\\\\sigma^{\\\\mathrm{max}}}\\\\right)^t \\\\|\\\\mathbf{w}_0 - \\\\mathbf{w}^\\\\ast\\\\|^2 \\\\] Larger condition number $\\\\to$ slower convergence. Transfer Learning via Linear Probing Given a pre-trained feature extractor $f_{\\\\theta}$, linear probing learns a classifier $h_{\\\\mathbf{w}}$ over a target dataset $\\\\mathcal{D}$: \\\\[ \\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{w}} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}, \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\theta) = \\\\sum_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}} \\\\ell(h_{\\\\mathbf{w}} \\\\circ f_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\] Immunization with Condition Number Goal & Setting Learn a pre-trained model $g_{\\\\omega} \\\\circ f_{\\\\theta^{\\\\mathrm{I}}}$ such that fine-tuning on a harmful task is difficult, but not for other tasks. The model should maintain good pre-training performance. We focus on linear probing with gradient descent. $\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}$: Harmful task dataset $\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}$: Pre-training (benign) task dataset $\\\\theta^{\\\\mathrm{I}}$: Immunized feature parameters $\\\\mathbf{w},\\\\omega$: Classifier head parameters $\\\\kappa(\\\\cdot)$: Condition number Definition (Immunized Model): (a) $\\\\kappa(\\\\nabla^2_{\\\\mathbf{w}}\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}, \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\theta^{\\\\mathrm{I}})) \\\\gg \\\\kappa(\\\\nabla^2_{\\\\mathbf{w}}\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}, \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\mathbf{I}))$ (b) $\\\\kappa(\\\\nabla^2_{\\\\omega}\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}, \\\\omega, \\\\theta^{\\\\mathrm{I}})) \\\\leq \\\\kappa(\\\\nabla^2_{\\\\omega}\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}, \\\\omega, \\\\mathbf{I}))$ (c) $\\\\min_{\\\\omega,\\\\theta} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}, \\\\omega, \\\\theta) \\\\approx \\\\min_{\\\\omega} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}, \\\\omega, \\\\theta^{\\\\mathrm{I}})$ Hessian for Linear Probing For $f_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top\\\\theta$ and $\\\\ell_2$ loss, the Hessian is: \\\\[ \\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}(\\\\theta) = \\\\nabla^2_{\\\\mathbf{w}}\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}, \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\theta) = \\\\theta^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{K}_{\\\\mathrm{H}} \\\\theta \\\\] where $\\\\mathbf{K}_{\\\\mathrm{H}} = \\\\mathbf{X}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{X}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}$ is the data covariance. Proposition: The singular values of the Hessian are \\\\[ \\\\sigma_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{D_{\\\\mathrm{in}}} \\\\left(\\\\sigma_{\\\\theta,i} (\\\\mathbf{u}_{\\\\theta,i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{q}_j) \\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma_j} \\\\right)^2 \\\\] where $\\\\sigma_{\\\\theta,i}, \\\\mathbf{u}_{\\\\theta,i}$ are the $i$-th singular value/vector of $\\\\theta$, and $\\\\gamma_j, \\\\mathbf{q}_j$ are for $\\\\mathbf{K}$. Insight: Immunization strength depends on the relative angle between the singular vectors of $\\\\theta$ and the data covariance matrices.

Monotonicity: Gradient descent on $\\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\mathrm{ill}}$ (resp. $\\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\mathrm{well}}$) guarantees a monotonic increase (resp. decrease) in the condition number for $\\\\theta^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\theta$: \\\\[ \\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\theta_{t+1})) > \\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\theta_t)) \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad \\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\theta_{t+1})) < \\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}(\\\\theta_t)) \\\\] for a suitable step size. Experiments Evaluation Metric We introduce the relative immunization ratio (RIR) to quantify immunization effectiveness: \\\\[ \\\\mathrm{RIR} = \\\\frac{\\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}(\\\\theta_{\\\\mathrm{I}}))/\\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}(\\\\mathbf{I}))}{\\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}(\\\\theta_{\\\\mathrm{I}}))/\\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{H}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}(\\\\mathbf{I}))} \\\\] A successful immunization has $\\\\mathrm{RIR} \\\\gg 1$, making harmful fine-tuning difficult while preserving performance on benign tasks. House Price Regression We first demonstrate our method on a house price regression task. Our approach achieves the highest RIR (356.20 \u00b1 5.49), significantly outperforming baselines: Baseline A: Only maximizes harmful task condition number (RIR = 1.24) Baseline B: Uses bi-level optimization (RIR = 2.00) Baseline C: Directly optimizes condition number difference (RIR = 92.58) To demonstrate how a large condition number affects convergence, we analyze the norm ratio $\\\\|\\\\mathbf{w}_t - \\\\mathbf{w}^\\\\star\\\\|_2^2 / \\\\|\\\\mathbf{w}_0 - \\\\mathbf{w}^\\\\star\\\\|_2^2$, which measures how the classifier weights $\\\\mathbf{w}_t$ at step $t$ approach the optimal weights $\\\\mathbf{w}^\\\\star$ during fine-tuning. We use exact line search to ensure fair comparison across methods. Our method achieves immunization while maintaining good performance on pre-training tasks. Pre-training task: Our method accelerates convergence Harmful task: Our method significantly slows convergence MNIST Classification We evaluate on MNIST digit classification, where each digit pair forms a task. Our method achieves robust immunization across all digit pairs with RIR = 70.04 \u00b1 3.28, while maintaining good performance on benign tasks. The heatmaps show the $\\\\log$ RIR for each digit pair. Baseline A Baseline B Baseline C Ours: Robust immunization across all digit pairs Deep Neural Networks We further evaluate our method on ImageNet pre-trained models (ResNet18 and ViT) with transfer tasks. We provide the test accuracy on the benign task ($\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{P}}$ = ImageNet1K) after immunization.: ResNet18: Test accuracy drops from 68.24% (initialization) to 62.36% (Cars as $\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}$) and 65.01% (Country211 as $\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}$). ViT: Test accuracy increases from 81.78% to 82.79% (Cars) and 83.17% (Country211). To show the effect of immunization, we fine-tune the immunized model on harmful tasks and report the test accuracy. These results suggest it is possible to immunize a non-linear model against a harmful task without losing (and even improving) performance on the benign task.

For instance, being able to\\nflow labeled datasets is a core task for applica-\\ntions ranging from domain adaptation to transfer\\nlearning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we\\npropose to represent each class by the associated\\nconditional distribution of features, and to model\\nthe dataset as a mixture distribution supported on\\nthese classes (which are themselves probability\\ndistributions), meaning that labeled datasets can\\nbe seen as probability distributions over proba-\\nbility distributions. We endow this space with a\\nmetric structure from optimal transport, namely\\nthe Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance,\\nderive a differential structure on this space, and\\ndefine WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to\\ndesign dynamics over this space that decrease a\\ngiven objective functional. We apply our frame-\\nwork to transfer learning and dataset distillation\\ntasks, leveraging our gradient flow construction\\nas well as novel tractable functionals that take\\nthe form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with\\nSliced-Wasserstein based kernels between proba-\\nbility distributions.\\n1. Introduction\\nProbability measures provide a powerful way to represent\\nmany data types. For instance, they allow to naturally repre-\\nsent documents (Kusner et al., 2015), genes (Bellazzi et al.,\\n2021), point clouds (Qi et al., 2017; Geuter et al., 2025),\\nimages (Sodini et al., 2025), or single-cell data (Persad et al.,\\n*Equal contribution1ENSAE, CREST, IP Paris2Universit \u00b4e\\nParis-Saclay, Laboratoire de Math \u00b4ematique d\u2019Orsay.

PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).2023; Haviv et al., 2024b). Remarkably, it has been shown\\nthat one can embed any finite dataset with little or no distor-\\ntion (Andoni et al., 2018; Kratsios et al., 2023) in the Wasser-\\nstein space, i.e., the space of probability distributions ( e.g.,\\nover a Euclidean space) equipped with the Wasserstein-2 dis-\\ntance from Optimal Transport (OT). This has motivated the\\nuse of this space to embed many types of data ranging from\\nwords (Vilnis & McCallum, 2015) to knowledge graphs\\n(He et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2022), graphs (Bojchevski &\\nG\u00a8unnemann, 2018; Petric Maretic et al., 2019), or neuro-\\nscience data (Bonet et al., 2023). Therefore, it is essential to\\ndevelop tools to work on the space of probability measures\\nover probability measures, also known as random measures.\\nIn particular, they provide a natural way to represent labeled\\ndatasets as mixtures (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2020).\\nA natural distance on this space is the Wasserstein over\\nWasserstein distance (WoW) (Nguyen, 2016; Catalano\\n& Lavenant, 2024), also known as the Hierarchical OT\\ndistance, which lifts the Wasserstein distance between prob-\\nability distributions as a ground cost, to define a Wasserstein\\ndistance between random measures. The latter has been used\\nfor generative modeling applications (Dukler et al., 2019),\\ndomain adaptation tasks (El Hamri et al., 2022), comparing\\ndocuments (Yurochkin et al., 2019) or multilevel clustering\\n(Ho et al., 2017). It has also been used to compare Gaussian\\nmixtures (Chen et al., 2018; Delon & Desolneux, 2020;\\nWilson et al., 2024) or generic mixtures (Dusson et al., 2023;\\nChen & Zhang, 2024). However, its poor sample complexity\\nhas motivated the development of alternative distance mea-\\nsures, such as those based on Integral Probability Metrics\\n(Catalano & Lavenant, 2024). Nonetheless, this space pos-\\nsesses a rich Riemannian structure, enabling the definition\\nof concepts like geodesics. This has been leveraged recently\\nby Haviv et al. (2024a) to perform generative modeling over\\nthe space of probability distributions with Flow Matchings.\\nWhile this space naturally supports a range of machine learn-\\ning tasks, optimization methods tailored to it have received\\nlimited attention. Yet, this is important for multiple ap-\\nplications, including variational inference with a Gaussian\\nmixture family (Lambert et al., 2022; Huix et al., 2024),\\ncomputing barycenters (Delon & Desolneux, 2020), or flow-\\ning datasets (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021), e.g., for domain\\nadaptation, transfer learning (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021;\\nHua et al., 2023) or dataset distillation (Wang et al., 2018).\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01W5jTHWQ2GUFHWSbEb6RrX6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect!

Pakkanen1Almut E. D. Veraart1\\nAbstract\\nThe expected signature maps a collection of data\\nstreams to a lower dimensional representation,\\nwith a remarkable property: the resulting fea-\\nture tensor can fully characterize the data gener-\\nating distribution. This \u201cmodel-free\u201d embedding\\nhas been successfully leveraged to build multi-\\nple domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) al-\\ngorithms for time series and sequential data. The\\nconvergence results proved in this paper bridge\\nthe gap between the expected signature\u2019s em-\\npirical discrete-time estimator and its theoreti-\\ncal continuous-time value, allowing for a more\\ncomplete probabilistic interpretation of expected\\nsignature-based ML methods. Moreover, when\\nthe data generating process is a martingale, we\\nsuggest a simple modification of the expected sig-\\nnature estimator with significantly lower mean\\nsquared error and empirically demonstrate how it\\ncan be effectively applied to improve predictive\\nperformance.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe signature transform of a stream of data is an infinite but\\ncountable sequence of its \u201citerated integrals\u201d summarizing\\nthe input in a top-down fashion, meaning the informational\\ncontent of its terms decays factorially. Originally introduced\\nby Chen (1954) and serving as a fundamental object of\\nrough path analysis (Lyons et al., 2007), the signature\\nS={S(X)[0,t]\u2208T((Rd)), t\u2208[0, T]},\\nof a path X={Xt, t\u2208[0, T]} \u2208C([0, T],Rd)is a lift\\n(in the sense that it embeds X) to the space of continuous\\nfunctions over the tensor algebra T((Rd))possessing some\\nnice algebraic and geometric properties. When the path is of\\nbounded variation, the signature is defined as the sequence\\n1Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, Lon-\\ndon, United Kingdom.

In this setting, two funda-\\nmental properties of the signature that make it a desirable\\nnon-parametric feature extraction method for sequential\\ndata are the characterization result of Hambly & Lyons\\n(2005) and the universality approximation theorem of Levin\\net al. (2016). Moreover, when the path Xis understood\\nas a (realization of a) random process with distribution P\\nover BV([0, T],Rd), the shuffle property of the signature\\nimplies that all moments of the random variable S(X)[0,T]\\nare determined by its expectation\\n\u03d5(T) :=E[S(X)[0,T]]\u2208T((Rd)).\\nA natural question, known as the Hamburger moment prob-\\nlem (Fawcett, 2003), is thus whether the expectation of\\nthe signature characterizes its law (and thus the law of the\\npath). When imposing a probability distribution PonX\\nthe assumption of bounded variation paths becomes quite\\nrestrictive: Brownian motion, the basic building block of\\nmany stochastic models, has paths of infinite variation al-\\nmost surely. Even if we observe a discrete-time stream of\\ndata, we often still would like to define the process Xas\\na latent stochastic process of which we observe the linear\\ninterpolation over some partition \u03c0of[0, T], hereafter de-\\nnoted by X\u03c0. We hence wish to make sense of the signature\\nof a stochastic process Xwith paths of unbounded variation.\\nFor a given path X\u2208C([0, T],Rd)of finite p-variation,\\nonce we \u201clift\u201d the process to a p-rough path (Lyons et al.,\\n2007, Definition 3.11) then the signature SofXis uniquely\\ndefined1. Without delving into the details of rough path\\ntheory, for our purposes it suffices to interpret the choice of\\nlift as fixing a notion of integration with respect to X: the\\nhigher order signatures terms are then understood as iterated\\nintegrals of the path Xdefined in this sense.\\n1This is the first fundamental theorem in the theory of rough\\npaths (Lyons et al., 2007, Theorem 3.7).\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01PDEYa8mj2x5BESGeCXZrBR"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect!

Existing Au-\\ntoML systems often require technical expertise\\nto set up complex tools, which is in general time-\\nconsuming and requires a large amount of human\\neffort. Therefore, recent works have started ex-\\nploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen\\nsuch burden and increase the usability of AutoML\\nframeworks via a natural language interface, al-\\nlowing non-expert users to build their data-driven\\nsolutions. These methods, however, are usually\\ndesigned only for a particular process in the AI\\ndevelopment pipeline and do not efficiently use\\nthe inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper pro-\\nposes AutoML-Agent , a novel multi-agent frame-\\nwork tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from\\ndata retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-\\nAgent takes user\u2019s task descriptions, facilitates\\ncollaboration between specialized LLM agents,\\nand delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike ex-\\nisting work, instead of devising a single plan, we\\nintroduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy\\nto enhance exploration to search for more optimal\\nplans. We also decompose each plan into sub-\\ntasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network\\ndesign) each of which is solved by a specialized\\nagent we build via prompting executing in parallel,\\nmaking the search process more efficient. More-\\nover, we propose a multi-stage verification to ver-\\nify executed results and guide the code generation\\nLLM in implementing successful solutions. Ex-\\ntensive experiments on seven downstream tasks\\nusing fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent\\nachieves a higher success rate in automating the\\nfull AutoML process, yielding systems with good\\nperformance throughout the diverse domains.\\n1DeepAuto.ai2KAIST, Seoul, South Korea.

Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).1. Introduction\\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) has significantly\\nreduced the need for technical expertise and human labors\\nin developing effective data-driven solutions by automating\\neach process in the AI development pipeline (Yao et al.,\\n2018; Ren et al., 2020; He et al., 2021), such as feature\\nengineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimiza-\\ntion (HPO). However, current AutoML systems (Gijsbers\\net al., 2024) often necessitate programming expertise to\\nconfigure complex tools and resources, potentially creating\\nbarriers for a larger pool of users with limited skills and\\nknowledge, such as domain experts (Sun et al. (2023); \u00a7A).\\nTo make AutoML frameworks more accessible to non-expert\\nusers, many recent studies (Trirat et al., 2021; Viswanathan\\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Hollmann et al., 2023b; Liu\\net al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhang\\net al., 2024a; Hong et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2024a; Yang\\net al., 2025; Chi et al., 2024) have suggested to use natural\\nlanguage interfaces with large language models (LLM) for\\nmachine learning (ML) and data science (DS) tasks. Nev-\\nertheless, these previous LLM-based AutoML frameworks\\nonly considered a limited number of tasks due to their re-\\nstricted designs, either only for a process in the pipeline (e.g.,\\nfeature engineering (Hollmann et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024;\\nMalberg et al., 2024), HPO (Liu et al., 2024a; 2025; Zhang\\net al., 2024a), and model selection (Zhang et al., 2023; Shen\\net al., 2023)) or for a specific group of downstream tasks\\n(e.g., natural language processing (Viswanathan et al., 2023)\\nand computer vision (Yang et al., 2025)). In addition, most\\nmethods overlook the inherent capability of LLMs to search\\nfor promising models by performing actual training of the\\ncandidate models during the search process, making it pro-\\nhibitively costly and slow.\\nFor an AutoML framework to be truly practical, it should\\nperform end-to-end AutoML, considering both the data\\naspects (retrieval, preprocessing, and feature engineering)\\nandmodel aspects (selection, HPO, and deployment). This\\nis because a process in one aspect can affect subsequent\\nprocesses in the other, potentially leading to suboptimal so-\\nlutions when combining results from different frameworks.\\nMeanwhile, the AutoML framework should be computation-\\nally efficient, using strategies to minimize the computational\\noverhead during search. However, there are two main chal-\\nlenges in building such a framework.\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01PP3m3V7ozLMJ4UpYp5RiWj"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now let me search for Patara Trirat's Google Scholar profile:", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01YNQH54qV9NkKVYxu2r1yuL", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "local-web_search", "arguments": "{\"query\": \"\\\"Patara Trirat\\\" \\\"DeepAuto.ai\\\" \\\"KAIST\\\" Google Scholar\", \"num_results\": 10}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Title: Patara Trirat\nLink: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fDZjV8EAAAAJ&hl=en\nSnippet: Patara Trirat.

However, lower errors\\non held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property\\nprediction tasks. We propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during\\nmolecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and\\ntheir performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to\\nmodels failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The\\nresulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks,\\nincluding materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.\\nCorrespondence: Xiang Fu ( xiangfu@meta.com ) and C.

Unfortunately, DFT calculations\\nare notoriously computationally intensive, scaling\\ncubically with the number of electrons in the sys-\\ntem: O(n3). Machine learning interatomic potentials\\n(MLIPs) are promising in approximating and expe-\\nditing DFT calculations. With increasing data set\\nsizes and model innovations, MLIPs have shown sub-\\nstantial improvements in accuracy and generalization\\ncapabilities (Batatia et al., 2023; Merchant et al.,\\n2023; Yang et al., 2024; Barroso-Luque et al., 2024).\\nPredicting physical properties in chemistry and ma-\\nterials science often requires complex workflows in-\\nvolving numerous evaluations of DFT or MLIPs. For\\nexample, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,\\nforces are predicted over thousands to millions of\\ntime steps. However, the MLIP literature has mostly\\nfocused on assessing models based on energy and\\nforce predictions over static DFT test sets rather\\nthan directly assessing their performance in complex\\nsimulations. This approach has limitations, as im-\\nproved accuracy on test sets does not always lead to\\nbetter predictions of physical properties (P\u00f3ta et al.,\\n2024; Loew et al., 2024).In this paper, we address two questions: Why does\\nhigher test accuracy sometimes fail to enhance a\\nmodel\u2019s ability to predict physical properties, and\\nhow can we improve MLIPs to excel in this area? We\\nfirst outline four critical property prediction tasks\\nand identify the properties required for an MLIP\\nto succeed in these tasks. These properties entail\\nlearning a conservative model with continuous and\\nbounded energy derivatives, indicating a smoothly-\\nvarying and physically meaningful energy landscape.\\nTo test whether these properties hold, we propose\\ntesting the ability of MLIPs to practically conserve\\nenergy in MD simulations. We demonstrate models\\nthat pass this test have a higher correlation between\\ntest errors and property prediction accuracy.\\nBuilding on these insights, we present a novel MLIP\\ncalled eSEN and training approach that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex\\nproperty prediction tasks. Specifically, our model\\nis capable of running energy-conserving MD simula-\\ntions for out-of-distribution systems (Figure 1 (a)).\\nFor materials stability prediction, eSEN achieves a\\nleading F1 score of 0.831and a \u03baSRMEof0.340on the\\ncompliant Matbench-Discovery benchmark (Riebe-\\nsell et al., 2023; P\u00f3ta et al., 2024).
