(-)\\\\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\\\\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\\\\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\\\\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\\\\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\\\\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\\\\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\\\\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning.

This is a critical bottleneck, as\\\\nsuch naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds\\\\nuse synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of\\\\nexisting models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the\\\\npretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new\\\\ntraining paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our\\\\napproach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during\\\\ntraining and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each\\\\ninput and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the\\\\ninstruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for\\\\nend-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution\\\\nmatching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the\\\\nimage manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard\\\\nbenchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,\\\\nour method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained\\\\non extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting.

Leveraging interactive pose priors,\\\\nPonimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that\\\\nuses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive\\\\nposes, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize\\\\ninteractive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are\\\\nunavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including\\\\nimage-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction\\\\nsynthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality\\\\nmocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse\\\\ndatasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and\\\\nthe effectiveness and robustness of our framework.\\\",\\n      \\\"categories\\\": [\\n        \\\"cs.CV\\\",\\n        \\\"cs.GR\\\",\\n        \\\"cs.RO\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"published\\\": \\\"2025-10-16T17:59:56+00:00\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14976v1\\\",\\n      \\\"resource_uri\\\": \\\"arxiv://2510.14976v1\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\",\"annotations\":null}",

Saxe* 1\\nAbstract\\nIn-context learning (ICL) is a powerful ability that\\nemerges in transformer models, enabling them\\nto learn from context without weight updates.\\nRecent work has established emergent ICL as a\\ntransient phenomenon that can sometimes dis-\\nappear after long training times. In this work,\\nwe sought a mechanistic understanding of these\\ntransient dynamics. Firstly, we find that\u2014after\\nthe disappearance of ICL\u2014the asymptotic strat-\\negy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights\\nand in-context learning, which we term \u201ccontext-\\nconstrained in-weights learning\u201d (CIWL). CIWL\\nis in competition with ICL, and eventually re-\\nplaces it as the dominant strategy of the model\\n(thus leading to ICL transience). However, we\\nalso find that the two competing strategies actu-\\nallyshare sub-circuits, which gives rise to coop-\\nerative dynamics as well. For example, in our\\nsetup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own,\\nand can only be enabled through the simultaneous\\nslow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL\\nthus both cooperates andcompetes with ICL, a\\nphenomenon we term \u201cstrategy coopetition\u201d. We\\npropose a minimal mathematical model that re-\\nproduces these key dynamics and interactions. In-\\nformed by this model, we were able to identify a\\nsetup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.\\n1. Introduction\\nTransformer-based large language models (LLMs) show an\\nimpressive propensity for in-context learning (ICL)\u2014the\\nability to use inputs at inference time to adapt behavior\\nand solve tasks not seen in training.

ICL is striking not only for its power, but\\nalso because it emerges without being explicitly trained\\nfor (as Brown et al. (2020) first observed, when training\\ntransformer models on internet-scale language corpora.).\\nNewer work has shown that ICL can sometimes in fact\\ndisappear after emerging, i.e. it can be transient over the\\ncourse of training (Singh et al., 2023; Anand et al., 2024;\\nHe et al., 2024).\\nThis evolving picture of ICL necessitates a deeper under-\\nstanding of the dynamics of ICL emergence (and transience).\\nICL is often viewed to be in competition with other strate-\\ngies (Nguyen & Reddy, 2024; Park et al., 2024), such as\\nIWL, with the tradeoff thought to be modulated by data\\nproperties (Chan et al., 2022; 2024), model size (Wei et al.,\\n2023), and/or training time (Singh et al., 2023). While com-\\npetition may explain why ICL gives way to other strategies\\nthrough the course of training, the question remains: why\\ndoes it emerge in the first place (if only to fade away)?\\nIn this work, we aim to extend the mechanistic understand-\\ning of ICL, which currently focuses on induction heads\\n(Olsson et al., 2022) and their emergence dynamics (Singh\\net al., 2024), to a richer dynamical setting involving multiple\\nstrategies cycling in and out over the course of learning. To\\ndo so, we reproduce and investigate the key transience result\\nin a simplified synthetic data setting with a 2-layer attention-\\nonly transformer. Using behavioral evaluators, we find the\\nasymptotic strategy after the disappearance of ICL is not\\npure in-weights learning. Rather, it is a surprising hybrid\\nstrategy that we term context-constrained in-weights learn-\\ning (CIWL, Section 4). The implementation of CIWL takes\\nthe form of skip-trigrams (Elhage et al., 2021) distributed\\nacross multiple heads in a form of superposition (Elhage\\net al., 2022). Perhaps even more remarkably, we find that\\neven though CIWL dominates over ICL asymptotically, both\\nstrategies share critical sub-circuits (Section 5.1), indicating\\ncooperative dynamics between these seemingly competitive\\nmechanisms\u2014a phenomenon we term \u201cstrategy coopeti-\\ntion.\u201d We borrow the term \u201ccoopetition\u201d from game theory,\\nwhere it describes situations where competitors simultane-\\nously cooperate and compete with each other.1Cooperation\\n1A classic historical examples is Hollywood studios in the early\\n1arXiv:2503.05631v2  [cs.LG]  10 Mar 2025\",\"annotations\":null}",

Yeh1\\nAbstract\\nModel immunization aims to pre-train models\\nthat are difficult to fine-tune on harmful tasks\\nwhile retaining their utility on other non-harmful\\ntasks. Though prior work has shown empirical ev-\\nidence for immunizing text-to-image models, the\\nkey understanding of when immunization is pos-\\nsible and a precise definition of an immunized\\nmodel remain unclear. In this work, we pro-\\npose a framework, based on the condition num-\\nber of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model im-\\nmunization for linear models. Building on this\\nframework, we design an algorithm with regular-\\nization terms to control the resulting condition\\nnumbers after pre-training. Empirical results on\\nlinear models and non-linear deep-nets demon-\\nstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm\\non model immunization. The code is available\\nathttps://github.com/amberyzheng/\\nmodel-immunization-cond-num .\\n1. Introduction\\nModel immunization, recently proposed by Zheng & Yeh\\n(2024), studies how to pre-train a model that is more difficult\\nto fine-tune on harmful content, but not others. The aim\\nis to mitigate the risk of misuse (Brundage et al., 2018;\\nMarchal et al., 2024) associated with open-sourced models\\nby immunizing them before they are released to the public.\\nZheng & Yeh (2024) focus on immunizing text-to-image\\nmodels, where they formulate immunization as a bi-level op-\\ntimization. Empirically, they show that pre-trained diffusion\\nmodels that undergo immunization are more difficult to fine-\\ntune on a given harmful concept dataset. To quantify this\\ndifficulty, they compare the generation quality of models\\nwith and without immunization after a fixed number of fine-\\ntuning iterations. While the empirical results are promising,\\n*Equal contribution1Department of Computer Science,\\nPurdue University. Correspondence to: Raymond A.

Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).a definition of an immunized model and the circumstances\\nthat make immunization possible remain unclear.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a framework to study\\nmodel immunization using the condition number (Gloub\\n& Van Loan, 1996). The effectiveness of immunization can\\nbe characterized by the condition number of the Hessian\\nmatrix. When using gradient-based methods during fine-\\ntuning, a condition number closer to one indicates faster\\nconvergence (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004), i.e., easier to\\nfine-tune. With this perspective, we observe that the ex-\\nistence of an effective immunization for linear models is\\nrelated to the angle between the singular vectors of the\\nharmful fine-tuning dataset\u2019s covariance matrix and the pre-\\ntraining dataset\u2019s covariance matrix.\\nFrom this condition number perspective, we propose an\\nimmunization algorithm to find such a model. In detail,\\nwe propose two additional terms to regularize the condi-\\ntion number during pre-training. Each of the introduced\\nregularization terms can be shown to ensure a monotonic\\nincrease/decrease of the condition number under gradient\\nupdates.\\nBeyond the theoretical results, we empirically validate the\\nproposed algorithm on linear models for regression and\\nimage classification tasks. Lastly, we conduct experiments\\nusing the proposed algorithm on non-linear models, i.e.,\\ndeep-nets. Despite the gap in theory, we observe that the\\nproposed approach remains effective at model immunization\\nacross ResNet (He et al., 2016) and ViT (Dosovitskiy, 2021).\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\n\u2022We introduce a framework based on the condition number\\nto study the task of model immunization. This framework\\nleads to a concrete definition of an immunized model\\nalong with a novel experiment setup and evaluation met-\\nric to compare the quality of different immunization tech-\\nniques.\\n\u2022We propose regularizers to maximize/minimize the con-\\ndition number, with a guaranteed monotonic increase/de-\\ncrease when updated with the gradient-based method.\\n\u2022Together with the task objective and regularizers, we\\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively im-\\nmunizes linear models and deep-nets on regression/image\\nclassification tasks.\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}",

The\\nemergence of such data requires radically novel\\ntechniques to design tractable gradient flows on\\nprobability distributions over this type of (infinite-\\ndimensional) objects. For instance, being able to\\nflow labeled datasets is a core task for applica-\\ntions ranging from domain adaptation to transfer\\nlearning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we\\npropose to represent each class by the associated\\nconditional distribution of features, and to model\\nthe dataset as a mixture distribution supported on\\nthese classes (which are themselves probability\\ndistributions), meaning that labeled datasets can\\nbe seen as probability distributions over proba-\\nbility distributions. We endow this space with a\\nmetric structure from optimal transport, namely\\nthe Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance,\\nderive a differential structure on this space, and\\ndefine WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to\\ndesign dynamics over this space that decrease a\\ngiven objective functional. We apply our frame-\\nwork to transfer learning and dataset distillation\\ntasks, leveraging our gradient flow construction\\nas well as novel tractable functionals that take\\nthe form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with\\nSliced-Wasserstein based kernels between proba-\\nbility distributions.\\n1. Introduction\\nProbability measures provide a powerful way to represent\\nmany data types. For instance, they allow to naturally repre-\\nsent documents (Kusner et al., 2015), genes (Bellazzi et al.,\\n2021), point clouds (Qi et al., 2017; Geuter et al., 2025),\\nimages (Sodini et al., 2025), or single-cell data (Persad et al.,\\n*Equal contribution1ENSAE, CREST, IP Paris2Universit \u00b4e\\nParis-Saclay, Laboratoire de Math \u00b4ematique d\u2019Orsay.

PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).2023; Haviv et al., 2024b). Remarkably, it has been shown\\nthat one can embed any finite dataset with little or no distor-\\ntion (Andoni et al., 2018; Kratsios et al., 2023) in the Wasser-\\nstein space, i.e., the space of probability distributions ( e.g.,\\nover a Euclidean space) equipped with the Wasserstein-2 dis-\\ntance from Optimal Transport (OT). This has motivated the\\nuse of this space to embed many types of data ranging from\\nwords (Vilnis & McCallum, 2015) to knowledge graphs\\n(He et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2022), graphs (Bojchevski &\\nG\u00a8unnemann, 2018; Petric Maretic et al., 2019), or neuro-\\nscience data (Bonet et al., 2023). Therefore, it is essential to\\ndevelop tools to work on the space of probability measures\\nover probability measures, also known as random measures.\\nIn particular, they provide a natural way to represent labeled\\ndatasets as mixtures (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2020).\\nA natural distance on this space is the Wasserstein over\\nWasserstein distance (WoW) (Nguyen, 2016; Catalano\\n& Lavenant, 2024), also known as the Hierarchical OT\\ndistance, which lifts the Wasserstein distance between prob-\\nability distributions as a ground cost, to define a Wasserstein\\ndistance between random measures. The latter has been used\\nfor generative modeling applications (Dukler et al., 2019),\\ndomain adaptation tasks (El Hamri et al., 2022), comparing\\ndocuments (Yurochkin et al., 2019) or multilevel clustering\\n(Ho et al., 2017). It has also been used to compare Gaussian\\nmixtures (Chen et al., 2018; Delon & Desolneux, 2020;\\nWilson et al., 2024) or generic mixtures (Dusson et al., 2023;\\nChen & Zhang, 2024). However, its poor sample complexity\\nhas motivated the development of alternative distance mea-\\nsures, such as those based on Integral Probability Metrics\\n(Catalano & Lavenant, 2024). Nonetheless, this space pos-\\nsesses a rich Riemannian structure, enabling the definition\\nof concepts like geodesics. This has been leveraged recently\\nby Haviv et al. (2024a) to perform generative modeling over\\nthe space of probability distributions with Flow Matchings.\\nWhile this space naturally supports a range of machine learn-\\ning tasks, optimization methods tailored to it have received\\nlimited attention. Yet, this is important for multiple ap-\\nplications, including variational inference with a Gaussian\\nmixture family (Lambert et al., 2022; Huix et al., 2024),\\ncomputing barycenters (Delon & Desolneux, 2020), or flow-\\ning datasets (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021), e.g., for domain\\nadaptation, transfer learning (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021;\\nHua et al., 2023) or dataset distillation (Wang et al., 2018).\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}",

This \u201cmodel-free\u201d embedding\\nhas been successfully leveraged to build multi-\\nple domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) al-\\ngorithms for time series and sequential data. The\\nconvergence results proved in this paper bridge\\nthe gap between the expected signature\u2019s em-\\npirical discrete-time estimator and its theoreti-\\ncal continuous-time value, allowing for a more\\ncomplete probabilistic interpretation of expected\\nsignature-based ML methods. Moreover, when\\nthe data generating process is a martingale, we\\nsuggest a simple modification of the expected sig-\\nnature estimator with significantly lower mean\\nsquared error and empirically demonstrate how it\\ncan be effectively applied to improve predictive\\nperformance.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe signature transform of a stream of data is an infinite but\\ncountable sequence of its \u201citerated integrals\u201d summarizing\\nthe input in a top-down fashion, meaning the informational\\ncontent of its terms decays factorially. Originally introduced\\nby Chen (1954) and serving as a fundamental object of\\nrough path analysis (Lyons et al., 2007), the signature\\nS={S(X)[0,t]\u2208T((Rd)), t\u2208[0, T]},\\nof a path X={Xt, t\u2208[0, T]} \u2208C([0, T],Rd)is a lift\\n(in the sense that it embeds X) to the space of continuous\\nfunctions over the tensor algebra T((Rd))possessing some\\nnice algebraic and geometric properties. When the path is of\\nbounded variation, the signature is defined as the sequence\\n1Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, Lon-\\ndon, United Kingdom.

In this setting, two funda-\\nmental properties of the signature that make it a desirable\\nnon-parametric feature extraction method for sequential\\ndata are the characterization result of Hambly & Lyons\\n(2005) and the universality approximation theorem of Levin\\net al. (2016). Moreover, when the path Xis understood\\nas a (realization of a) random process with distribution P\\nover BV([0, T],Rd), the shuffle property of the signature\\nimplies that all moments of the random variable S(X)[0,T]\\nare determined by its expectation\\n\u03d5(T) :=E[S(X)[0,T]]\u2208T((Rd)).\\nA natural question, known as the Hamburger moment prob-\\nlem (Fawcett, 2003), is thus whether the expectation of\\nthe signature characterizes its law (and thus the law of the\\npath). When imposing a probability distribution PonX\\nthe assumption of bounded variation paths becomes quite\\nrestrictive: Brownian motion, the basic building block of\\nmany stochastic models, has paths of infinite variation al-\\nmost surely. Even if we observe a discrete-time stream of\\ndata, we often still would like to define the process Xas\\na latent stochastic process of which we observe the linear\\ninterpolation over some partition \u03c0of[0, T], hereafter de-\\nnoted by X\u03c0. We hence wish to make sense of the signature\\nof a stochastic process Xwith paths of unbounded variation.\\nFor a given path X\u2208C([0, T],Rd)of finite p-variation,\\nonce we \u201clift\u201d the process to a p-rough path (Lyons et al.,\\n2007, Definition 3.11) then the signature SofXis uniquely\\ndefined1. Without delving into the details of rough path\\ntheory, for our purposes it suffices to interpret the choice of\\nlift as fixing a notion of integration with respect to X: the\\nhigher order signatures terms are then understood as iterated\\nintegrals of the path Xdefined in this sense.\\n1This is the first fundamental theorem in the theory of rough\\npaths (Lyons et al., 2007, Theorem 3.7).\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}",

Existing Au-\\ntoML systems often require technical expertise\\nto set up complex tools, which is in general time-\\nconsuming and requires a large amount of human\\neffort. Therefore, recent works have started ex-\\nploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen\\nsuch burden and increase the usability of AutoML\\nframeworks via a natural language interface, al-\\nlowing non-expert users to build their data-driven\\nsolutions. These methods, however, are usually\\ndesigned only for a particular process in the AI\\ndevelopment pipeline and do not efficiently use\\nthe inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper pro-\\nposes AutoML-Agent , a novel multi-agent frame-\\nwork tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from\\ndata retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-\\nAgent takes user\u2019s task descriptions, facilitates\\ncollaboration between specialized LLM agents,\\nand delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike ex-\\nisting work, instead of devising a single plan, we\\nintroduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy\\nto enhance exploration to search for more optimal\\nplans. We also decompose each plan into sub-\\ntasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network\\ndesign) each of which is solved by a specialized\\nagent we build via prompting executing in parallel,\\nmaking the search process more efficient. More-\\nover, we propose a multi-stage verification to ver-\\nify executed results and guide the code generation\\nLLM in implementing successful solutions. Ex-\\ntensive experiments on seven downstream tasks\\nusing fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent\\nachieves a higher success rate in automating the\\nfull AutoML process, yielding systems with good\\nperformance throughout the diverse domains.\\n1DeepAuto.ai2KAIST, Seoul, South Korea.

Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).1. Introduction\\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) has significantly\\nreduced the need for technical expertise and human labors\\nin developing effective data-driven solutions by automating\\neach process in the AI development pipeline (Yao et al.,\\n2018; Ren et al., 2020; He et al., 2021), such as feature\\nengineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimiza-\\ntion (HPO). However, current AutoML systems (Gijsbers\\net al., 2024) often necessitate programming expertise to\\nconfigure complex tools and resources, potentially creating\\nbarriers for a larger pool of users with limited skills and\\nknowledge, such as domain experts (Sun et al. (2023); \u00a7A).\\nTo make AutoML frameworks more accessible to non-expert\\nusers, many recent studies (Trirat et al., 2021; Viswanathan\\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Hollmann et al., 2023b; Liu\\net al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhang\\net al., 2024a; Hong et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2024a; Yang\\net al., 2025; Chi et al., 2024) have suggested to use natural\\nlanguage interfaces with large language models (LLM) for\\nmachine learning (ML) and data science (DS) tasks. Nev-\\nertheless, these previous LLM-based AutoML frameworks\\nonly considered a limited number of tasks due to their re-\\nstricted designs, either only for a process in the pipeline (e.g.,\\nfeature engineering (Hollmann et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024;\\nMalberg et al., 2024), HPO (Liu et al., 2024a; 2025; Zhang\\net al., 2024a), and model selection (Zhang et al., 2023; Shen\\net al., 2023)) or for a specific group of downstream tasks\\n(e.g., natural language processing (Viswanathan et al., 2023)\\nand computer vision (Yang et al., 2025)). In addition, most\\nmethods overlook the inherent capability of LLMs to search\\nfor promising models by performing actual training of the\\ncandidate models during the search process, making it pro-\\nhibitively costly and slow.\\nFor an AutoML framework to be truly practical, it should\\nperform end-to-end AutoML, considering both the data\\naspects (retrieval, preprocessing, and feature engineering)\\nandmodel aspects (selection, HPO, and deployment). This\\nis because a process in one aspect can affect subsequent\\nprocesses in the other, potentially leading to suboptimal so-\\nlutions when combining results from different frameworks.\\nMeanwhile, the AutoML framework should be computation-\\nally efficient, using strategies to minimize the computational\\noverhead during search. However, there are two main chal-\\nlenges in building such a framework.\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}",

However, lower errors\\non held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property\\nprediction tasks. We propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during\\nmolecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and\\ntheir performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to\\nmodels failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The\\nresulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks,\\nincluding materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.\\nCorrespondence: Xiang Fu ( xiangfu@meta.com ) and C. Lawrence Zitnick ( zitnick@meta.com )\\nCode: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem\\nCheckpoints: https://huggingface.co/facebook/OMAT24\\n1 Introduction\\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT), which models the\\nelectrons in materials and molecules, serves as the\\nfoundation for many modern drug and materials dis-\\ncovery workflows. Unfortunately, DFT calculations\\nare notoriously computationally intensive, scaling\\ncubically with the number of electrons in the sys-\\ntem: O(n3). Machine learning interatomic potentials\\n(MLIPs) are promising in approximating and expe-\\nditing DFT calculations. With increasing data set\\nsizes and model innovations, MLIPs have shown sub-\\nstantial improvements in accuracy and generalization\\ncapabilities (Batatia et al., 2023; Merchant et al.,\\n2023; Yang et al., 2024; Barroso-Luque et al., 2024).\\nPredicting physical properties in chemistry and ma-\\nterials science often requires complex workflows in-\\nvolving numerous evaluations of DFT or MLIPs. For\\nexample, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,\\nforces are predicted over thousands to millions of\\ntime steps. However, the MLIP literature has mostly\\nfocused on assessing models based on energy and\\nforce predictions over static DFT test sets rather\\nthan directly assessing their performance in complex\\nsimulations. This approach has limitations, as im-\\nproved accuracy on test sets does not always lead to\\nbetter predictions of physical properties (P\u00f3ta et al.,\\n2024; Loew et al., 2024).In this paper, we address two questions: Why does\\nhigher test accuracy sometimes fail to enhance a\\nmodel\u2019s ability to predict physical properties, and\\nhow can we improve MLIPs to excel in this area? We\\nfirst outline four critical property prediction tasks\\nand identify the properties required for an MLIP\\nto succeed in these tasks. These properties entail\\nlearning a conservative model with continuous and\\nbounded energy derivatives, indicating a smoothly-\\nvarying and physically meaningful energy landscape.\\nTo test whether these properties hold, we propose\\ntesting the ability of MLIPs to practically conserve\\nenergy in MD simulations. We demonstrate models\\nthat pass this test have a higher correlation between\\ntest errors and property prediction accuracy.\\nBuilding on these insights, we present a novel MLIP\\ncalled eSEN and training approach that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex\\nproperty prediction tasks. Specifically, our model\\nis capable of running energy-conserving MD simula-\\ntions for out-of-distribution systems (Figure 1 (a)).\\nFor materials stability prediction, eSEN achieves a\\nleading F1 score of 0.831and a \u03baSRMEof0.340on the\\ncompliant Matbench-Discovery benchmark (Riebe-\\nsell et al., 2023; P\u00f3ta et al., 2024). Previous models\\nare only able to excel in one of these metrics ( Fig-\\nure 1 (b,c)). We also achieve a SOTA F1 score of\\n0.925and\u03baSRMEof0.170on the non-compliant cate-\\n1arXiv:2502.12147v2  [physics.comp-ph]  23 Apr 2025\",\"annotations\":null}",
