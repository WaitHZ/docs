relationship of it with respect to LLM capacity is under-explored.\\nIn this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning performances of a supervised LLM.\\nWe find that pre-training loss is a better indicator of the model&#x27;s performance than the model&#x27;s parameter count.\\nWe apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and empirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model performance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised datasets.\\nTo augment more data samples for improving model performances without any human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT).\\nRFT uses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as augmented fine-tuning datasets.\\nWe find with augmented samples containing more distinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more for LLMs.\\nWe also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs.\\nFurthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push LLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3\\\\% on GSM8K which outperforms the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9\\\\% significantly.</span></div><div><strong class=\\\"note-content-field disable-tex-rendering\\\">Anonymous Url<!-- -->:</strong>

under-explored.\\\\nIn this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning performances of a supervised LLM.\\\\nWe find that pre-training loss is a better indicator of the model's performance than the model's parameter count.\\\\nWe apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and empirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model performance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised datasets.\\\\nTo augment more data samples for improving model performances without any human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT).\\\\nRFT uses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as augmented fine-tuning datasets.\\\\nWe find with augmented samples containing more distinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more for LLMs.\\\\nWe also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs.\\\\nFurthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push LLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3\\\\\\\\% on GSM8K which outperforms the
