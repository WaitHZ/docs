## Instruction

I am conducting research on papers for an AI Conference. For each paper, please help me find the full name of the first author, the complete institutional affiliation of the first author exactly as it appears in the paper (including all institutions if multiple are listed, and specifying down to the department level when provided), and the link to the first author’s Google Scholar profile. You need to fill them in the corresponding excel sheet under my workspace.
